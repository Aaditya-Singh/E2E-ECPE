2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person

1,null,null,More reports came to us about Suwarora
2,null,null,all of the most inviting nature
3,null,null,but nothing else worth mentioning occurred until we reached the border of Msalala

5,null,null,who said he was a bigger man than his chief
6,null,null,demanded a tax
7,null,null,which I refused
8,null,null,and the dispute ended in his snatching Nasib 's gun out of his hands
9,null,null,I thought little of this affair myself
10,sadness,regretting,beyond regretting the delay which it might occasion
11,null,null,as M'yonga
12,null,null,I knew
13,null,null,would not permit such usage
14,null,null,if I chose to go round by his palace and make a complaint
15,null,null,Both Bui and Nasib
16,null,null,however
17,null,null,were so greatly alarmed
18,null,null,that before I could say a word they got the gun back again by paying four yards merikani .

3,null,null,but said he could not interfere with the rights of his officers
4,null,null,He did not wish himself to take anything from us
5,null,null,and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted
6,null,null,Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers
7,null,null,and begged us to have patience

5,null,null,had my words aroused in the count 's mind
6,null,null,I could not understand or imagine why he should regard my question as strange or unnatural
7,null,null,On the contrary
8,null,null,I thought it perfectly natural

1,null,null,In part because she had always been so reserved a child
2,null,null,in part because there had been no one in whom she might confide even had she wished it

4,null,null,he was influenced to a certain extent by the things with which he surrounded himself
5,null,null,Primarily
6,null,null,from certain traits of his character
7,null,null,one would have imagined him called to be a citizen of eminent respectability and worth
8,null,null,He appeared to be an ideal home man

10,null,null,leaving the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried
11,happiness,well stationed,Here he could feel that he was well stationed and physically happy in life
12,null,null,The thought of the dinner table with candles upon it ( his idea )

14,null,null,the thought of a large fireplace flaming with solid lengths of cord wood
15,null,null,and Lillian snuggling in his arms
16,null,null,gripped his immature imagination
17,null,null,As has been said before
18,null,null,he cared nothing for books

2,null,null,However
3,null,null,Cowperwood was not troubled about this
4,happiness,delightful,It struck him as delightful and exceedingly worth while that she should be so devoted
5,null,null,At the same time
6,null,null,her lethargic manner
7,null,null,vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference
8,null,null,which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security
9,null,null,attracted him also .
1225 6
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,strange,This current war spirit was strange
2,null,null,The people seemed to him to want to hear nothing but the sound of the drum and fife
3,null,null,to see nothing but troops
4,null,null,of which there were thousands now passing through on their way to the front
5,null,null,carrying cold steel in the shape of guns at their shoulders
6,null,null,to hear of war and the rumors of war .
1245 9
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,"  Wait till you see them
2,happiness,pleased,I think you will be pleased

7,null,null,But yours  "   He went off into a description of the entrance hall
8,null,null,reception room and parlor
9,null,null,which he was arranging and decorating in such a way as to give an effect of size and dignity not really conformable to the actual space .
1250 25
 (25, 25),
1,null,null,Cowperwood knew that there were such properties
2,null,null,His very alert mind had long since sensed the general opportunities here
3,null,null,The omnibuses were slowly disappearing
4,null,null,The best routes were already preempted
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,there were other streets
7,null,null,and the city was growing

9,null,null,One could afford to pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait and extend the lines into larger and better areas later
10,null,null,And already he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the  "  endless chain
11,null,null,"   or  "  agreeable formula
12,null,null,"   as it was later termed
13,null,null,of buying a certain property on a long-time payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient not only to pay your seller
14,null,null,but to reimburse you for your trouble
15,null,null,to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other things  allied properties
16,null,null,for instance
17,null,null,against which more bonds could be issued
18,null,null,and so on
19,null,null,ad infinitum
20,null,null,It became an old story later
21,null,null,but it was new at that time
22,null,null,and he kept the thought closely to himself
23,null,null,None the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this
24,null,null,since street railways were his hobby
25,happiness,convinced,and he was convinced that he would be a great master of them if he ever had an opportunity to control them .
1263 10
 (3, 5),
1,null,null,And then she came to the matter of a train gown
2,null,null,Kathleen laid out five
3,happiness,honor,for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently
4,null,null,and she had
5,null,null,with the permission of her mother and father
6,null,null,indulged herself to the full
7,null,null,She studied a golden-yellow silk
8,null,null,with cream lace shoulder straps
9,null,null,and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully
10,null,null,but set it aside .
1269 8
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,I just wanted to see how you danced
3,null,null,"   she said
4,null,null,tamely
5,null,null,the force of her original feeling having been weakened by a thought of what she was doing
6,happiness,smiled,He noted the change and smiled
7,null,null,It was lovely to be dancing with her
8,null,null,He had not thought mere dancing could hold such charm .
1272 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Still
2,null,null,now that he had said this
3,null,null,strong thoughts of her were in his mind
4,null,null,And despite his involved social and financial position
5,null,null,which he now recalled
6,happiness,interesting,it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even calculatingly and worse
7,null,null,enthusiastically  he was pumping the bellows that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl
8,null,null,to feed a fire that might ultimately consume him and how deliberately and resourcefully
1277 25
 (21, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident
3,null,null,in so many ways
4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then
18,null,null,O Heavens
19,null,null,the palaver
20,null,null,What beatings of tom-toms
21,anger,platitudes,What mouthings of pharisaical moralities platitudes
22,null,null,Run now
23,null,null,good people
24,null,null,for you may see clearly how evil is dealt with in high places
25,null,null,It made him smile .
1303 6
 (4, 1),
1,null,null,Things had changed considerably for him since the days when he had been fortuitously and almost indifferently made city treasurer
2,null,null,His method of dressing had so much improved since he had been inducted into office
3,null,null,and his manner expressed so much more good feeling
4,happiness,confidence,confidence
5,null,null,aplomb
6,null,null,that he would not have recognized himself if he had been permitted to see himself as had those who had known him before .
1306 7
 (1, 2),
1,happiness,intoxicated,This intoxicated him
2,null,null,for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long contemplated dream that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line
3,null,null,issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public
4,null,null,using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way
5,null,null,In short
6,null,null,he was one of those early
7,null,null,daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement .
1318 15
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,They were allied in no one particular financial proposition
2,null,null,any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were
3,null,null,And besides
4,null,null,in all probability Cowperwood was no fool
5,null,null,He was not equally guilty with Stener
6,null,null,the latter had loaned him money
7,null,null,The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues
8,null,null,but he decided not
9,null,null,Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind
10,happiness,splendid,It was a splendid chance but dangerous
11,null,null,He had better go it alone
12,null,null,For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could
13,null,null,If not
14,null,null,Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party
15,null,null,if need be .

1,null,null,"  But what can I do
2,null,null,Frank

2,null,null,to see the King looking out of the Council window
3,null,null,At night my Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power to act
4,null,null,are granted by the Council .
1685 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,He seemed to be in a melancholy humour

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There were men in that forecastle as good citizens and as brave fellows as you would wish to meet men who in their own sphere would have commanded and obtained respect
2,sadness,painful,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
3,null,null,Half starved and hopeless
4,null,null,their spirit had been so broken
5,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
6,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
7,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves .
1738 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,null,null,t as for danger well
3,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
4,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1753 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I felt sure
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
4,null,null,In fact
5,fear,afraid,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
6,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
7,null,null,We hauled steadily away
8,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
9,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1769 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,I said as cheerfully as I could
2,null,null,"  All right
3,null,null,sir
4,null,null,"   trying to look unconcerned
5,null,null,telling myself not to be a coward
6,null,null,and all sorts of things
7,fear,scared,but the cold truth is that I was scared almost to death because I didnt know what was coming  .  However
8,null,null,I did the best thing under the circumstances
9,null,null,obeyed orders and looked steadily astern
10,null,null,or up into the bronzed impassive face of my chief
11,null,null,who towered above me
12,null,null,scanning with eagle eyes the sea ahead .
1771 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,So we toiled watch and watch
2,null,null,six hours on and six off
3,null,null,the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty
4,null,null,and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great
5,fear,dangerous,there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business
6,null,null,That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil
7,null,null,Some of these were of enormous size
8,null,null,containing 350 gallons when full
9,null,null,and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk .
1775 7
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,He made a fearful to-do over it
2,null,null,rolling completely over several times backward and forward
3,null,null,at the same time smiting the sea with his mighty tail
4,null,null,making an almost deafening noise and pother
5,happiness,comfortable,But we were comfortable enough
6,null,null,while we un shipped the mast and made ready for action
7,null,null,being sufficiently far away from him to escape the full effect of his gambols .
1806 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The truth of Mr
2,null,null,Count 's forecast was verified to the hilt
3,null,null,for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about
4,null,null,the body that he was unable to move
5,null,null,while one of the hands
6,null,null,a Portuguese
7,null,null,was injured internally
8,null,null,and seemed very bad indeed
9,sadness,sorry,Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones
10,null,null,we should have scoffed at the notion
11,null,null,and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart .
1815 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Not seeing what had happened to his iron
2,null,null,or knowing that we were fast
3,null,null,the other harpooner promptly hurled his second iron
4,null,null,which struck solidly
5,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle
6,fear,bad,but our position was rather bad
7,null,null,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear
8,null,null,we were struggling frantically to get our sail down
9,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .

1,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle

3,anger,rage,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear

5,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .
1833 13
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent
2,null,null,I hope I shall be excused  .  Remembering
3,null,null,however
4,null,null,that all our lives depended on keeping cool
5,null,null,I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces
6,null,null,but compel myself to think and act calmly
7,null,null,since I was responsible for others
8,null,null,If the animal had not been in so blind a fury
9,fear,afraid,I am afraid my task would have been much harder
10,null,null,but he was mad
11,null,null,and his savage rushes were
12,null,null,though disquieting
13,null,null,unsystematic and clumsy .

 (7, 6),
1,null,null,Every Londoner knows how strongly that beautiful scent appeals to him
2,null,null,even when wafted from draggled branches borne slumwards by tramping urchins who have been far afield despoiling the trees of their lovely blossoms
3,null,null,careless of the damage they have been doing
4,null,null,But to me
5,null,null,who had not seen a bit for years
6,null,null,the flood of feeling undammed by that odorous breath
7,fear,overwhelming,was overwhelming
8,null,null,I could hardly tear myself away from the spot
9,null,null,and
10,null,null,when at last I did
11,null,null,found myself continually turning to try and catch another whiff of one of the most beautiful scents in the world .
1861 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Making myself at home with him
2,null,null,I desired to know what brought him so far from the  "  big smoke
3,null,null,"   and on board a whaler of all places in the world
4,null,null,He told me he had been a Pickford 's van driver
5,null,null,but had emigrated to New Zealand
6,disgust,did not at all like,finding that he did not at all like himself in the new country
7,null,null,Trying to pick and choose instead of manfully choosing a pick and shovel for a beginning
8,null,null,he got hard up .
1865 10
 (7, 5),
1,null,null,At the close of our operations the welcome news was made public that four more fish like the present one would fill us bung up
2,null,null,and that we should then
3,null,null,after a brief visit to the Bluff
4,null,null,start direct for home
5,null,null,This announcement
6,null,null,though expected for some time past
7,surprise,amazing,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
8,null,null,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
9,null,null,where stern
10,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule .
1872 11

5,null,null,trying to decide whether it or you are going the faster
6,null,null,when suddenly there seems to be a hush
7,null,null,almost a lull
8,null,null,in the uproar
9,null,null,You look astern
10,null,null,and see a wall of water rising majestically higher and higher
11,null,null,at the same time drawing nearer and nearer .

4,fear,panic,A panic had come since Mr Semple had died
5,null,null,which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was
6,null,null,There was really a severe business depression .

2,null,null,in flashes like high notes of sound
3,happiness,joy,with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were  "  worth "   than  most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side  of the pane
4,null,null,Stransom lingered long enough to suspend
5,null,null,in a  vision
6,null,null,a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim
7,null,null,and  then was kept an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew .

2,null,null,that her aunt 's tiny fortune had come to  her
3,null,null,so that there was henceforth only one to consume what had  formerly been made to suffice for two
4,happiness,joy,This was a joy to Stransom
5,null,null,because it had hitherto been equally impossible for him either to  offer her presents or contentedly to stay his hand
6,null,null,It was too  ugly to be at her side that way
