5,null,null,his emotion was greatly mitigated by the satisfaction he felt at having succeeded so quickly and so completely
6,null,null,Madame d' argeles had confessed everything
7,null,null,This was indeed a victory
8,null,null,for it must be admitted that he had trembled lest she should deny all

6,null,null,The more they were shouted at
7,null,null,the closer they huddled together

7,surprise,surprised,He looked so much younger today that Bruno was surprised
8,null,null,in fact he reminded him of the big boys at school

9,null,null,as if he were wondering what to say to such a thing

11,null,null,' yes I am
12,surprise,surprise,Bruno stared at him in surprise

2,null,null,As he continued his prayer she felt all her old terror return
3,null,null,that terror that she had known on the night her father died
4,null,null,during the hours that she had watched beside his dead body

1,null,null,From time to time we landed at various islands
2,null,null,where we sold or exchanged our merchandise
3,null,null,and one day
4,null,null,when the wind dropped suddenly
5,null,null,we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow
6,null,null,which only rose slightly above the surface of the water
7,null,null,Our sails were furled
8,null,null,and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves
9,null,null,I was among the number
10,null,null,but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us
11,null,null,we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island
12,null,null,while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives
13,null,null,since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale
14,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
15,null,null,others sprang into the sea
16,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
17,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
18,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
19,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
20,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
21,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
22,null,null,now beaten this way
23,null,null,now that
24,sadness,despaired,and when night fell I despaired for my life
25,null,null,but
26,null,null,weary and spent as I was
27,null,null,I clung to my frail support
28,null,null,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island .

1,null,null,The porter looked about him
2,null,null,noticing and admiring everything
3,null,null,but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne
4,null,null,who was even more beautiful than the other two
5,null,null,By the respect shown to her by the others
6,null,null,he judged that she must be the eldest
7,null,null,and in this he was right
8,null,null,This lady 's name was Zobeida
9,null,null,the porteress was Sadie
10,null,null,and the housekeeper was Amina
11,null,null,At a word from Zobeida
12,null,null,Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter
13,null,null,who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight
14,null,null,and when it was emptied
15,null,null,paid him handsomely for its use
16,null,null,But instead of taking up his basket and going away
17,null,null,the man still lingered
18,null,null,till Zobeida inquired what he was waiting for
19,null,null,and if he expected more money
20,null,null,"  Oh
21,null,null,madam
22,null,null,"   returned he
23,null,null,"  you have already given me too much
24,fear,fear,and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my departure at once
25,null,null,But
26,null,null,if you will pardon my saying so
27,null,null,I was lost in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves
28,null,null,A company of women without men is
29,null,null,however
30,null,null,as dull as a company of men without women
31,null,null,And after telling some stories to prove his point

6,surprise,surprise,To his great surprise
7,null,null,he heard her saying to some one inside

779 7

1,null,null,As a small child he never obeyed the impulse to take a piece of cake without looking around to see if his mother and father approved . He would not play unreservedly
2,null,null,in the whole-hearted impulsive way of children
3,fear,fear,but always held back in his enjoyment as if he feared that perhaps he was not doing just right . When he started to go to school his fear of doing the wrong thing made him appear rather slow
4,null,null,though in reality he was bright . The other children called him a  "  sissy
5,null,null,"   mistaking his conscientiousness for cowardice  .  This grieved him very much
6,null,null,and his father undertook to educate him in  "  rough "   ways
7,null,null,in fighting and wrestling .

12,null,null,Gowing dropped in just in time
13,null,null,bringing with him a large sheet
14,null,null,with a print of a tailless donkey
15,null,null,which he fastened against the wall
16,null,null,He then produced several separate tails
17,null,null,and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper place

911 5
 (4, 4),

2,null,null,Maggie sat between her two aunts
3,surprise,surprise,She could not feel for the moment anything but a startled surprise at the ugliness of the building
4,null,null,She had entered at different times the Glebeshire chapels
5,null,null,but their primitive position and need had given them the spirit of honest sincerity .

1,null,null,This was beyond Maggie altogether
2,happiness,agreeable,An agreeable thing
3,null,null,however
4,null,null,about Mr
5,null,null,Magnus was that he did not mind when you disliked his work
6,null,null,He seemed to expect that you would not like it
7,null,null,He was certainly a very un conceited man .
942 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Oh yes
2,null,null,one of them went back
3,null,null,I remember
4,sadness,disappointing,But his actual meeting with his girl was so disappointing in comparison with his long expectation of it in front of the Temple that he took the next boat back to the island
5,null,null,but he never found it again
6,null,null,He travelled everywhere and died
7,null,null,a disappointed man
8,null,null,at sea .  "

2,null,null,Her little escape into the streets
3,null,null,her posting of the letter
4,null,null,had been followed so immediately by Uncle Mathew 's visit

2,null,null,Soon Martin would marry her and they would go away
3,null,null,Her aunt would be sorry of course
4,null,null,and his father
5,null,null,perhaps
6,anger,angry,would be angry
7,null,null,but the sorrow and anger would be only for a little while
8,null,null,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,null,null,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,null,null,she supposed
11,null,null,also his .
966 4
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,pleased,Maggie was maliciously pleased to observe that Miss Avies had not expected these additions to her number and was now in danger of an uncomfortable squashing
2,null,null,there was
3,null,null,indeed
4,null,null,a polite little struggle between Miss Avies and Aunt Anne as to who should have the corner with a wooden arm upon which to rest .
969 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She set back her shoulders
2,null,null,sat up stiffly
3,null,null,and tried to look as old as she might  that was not
4,null,null,unhappily
5,null,null,very old
6,happiness,happy,That smile exchanged with Martin had made her happy for ever
7,null,null,Miss Avies was of less than no importance at all
976 12
 (8, 8),

6,null,null,terribly
7,null,null,I always have been since I was very little
8,sadness,embarrassed,and just to enter a room when other people are there makes me so embarrassed
9,null,null,I remember once when mother was alive her scolding me because I would n't come in to a tea party
10,null,null,But I could n't
11,null,null,I stood outside the door in an agony
12,null,null,doing everything to make myself go in but I could n't

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Nevertheless there did come to her suddenly then a new tenderness for her aunt
2,sadness,pain,the actual sight of her pain in the Chapel had deeply touched her and now her eagerness for escape was mingled with a longing to be affectionate and good .
979 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Then Martin had come
2,null,null,and suddenly she had seen how dangerously her life was hemming her in
3,null,null,She was losing courage

3,null,null,father all this Second Coming and the rest of it .
998 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Two events occurred that filled her mind and made the week pass quickly
2,null,null,One was that she received an answer to her adventurous letter
3,null,null,the other was a remarkable conversation with Miss Caroline Smith
4,null,null,The answer to her letter was lying on her plate when she came down to breakfast
5,happiness,excited,and Aunt Elizabeth was watching it with an excited stare .
999 7
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,nothing
3,null,null,"   said Maggie
4,null,null,slowly
5,null,null,Then she went on
6,null,null,laughing :   "  i 've been asked out to tea for the first time in my life
7,fear,frightened,And im terribly frightened .  "
1004 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The boldness
2,happiness,excitement,the excitement of this inflamed her
3,null,null,It was so like her to challenge any action once she was in it by taking it to its furthest limit
4,null,null,She put it in an envelope and wrote Martin 's name with a flourish .
1018 5
 (1, 1),
1,fear,terrible,"  It 's terrible all this that 's going on
2,null,null,You know about it
3,null,null,of course Warlock 's visions I mean and the trouble it 's making
4,null,null,im outside it and you 're outside it
5,null,null,but we 're being brought into it all the same how can we help it when we love the people who are in it
1023 3
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,caution,When Aunt Anne moved now it was with infinite caution
2,null,null,as though she were stalking her enemy and was afraid lest any incautious gesture should betray her into his ambush
3,null,null,No less marked than her torture was her courage and the expectation that sustained that courage .
1031 6
 (1, 2),(1, 5),
1,happiness,a terrific excitement,It was a terrific excitement for her
2,null,null,apart altogether from her love for Martin
3,null,null,She had
4,null,null,of course
5,null,null,never been to a theatre
6,null,null,She could not imagine in the least what it was like .
1035 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her
2,happiness,confused,She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because he seemed glad to see her
3,null,null,He looked the very picture of a well-dressed
4,null,null,kindly
5,null,null,genial friend who had known her all his life
6,null,null,He was wearing a beautifully shining top-hat and his stiff white collar gleamed .
1038 10
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Stupid the pleasure that his few words had given her
2,null,null,but she felt once again
3,null,null,as she had felt in Katherine Mark 's drawing-room
4,null,null,the contact with that other world
5,null,null,that safe
6,null,null,happy
7,null,null,comfortable
8,null,null,assured world in which everything was exactly what it seemed
9,happiness,glad,She was glad that he liked her and that his sister liked her
10,null,null,Then she could not be so wild and odd and uncivilised as she often was afraid that she was .
1041 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But as the play continued she must listen
2,happiness,was thrilling to her,It was her very first play and soon it was thrilling to her so that she forgot
3,null,null,for a time
4,null,null,even Martin
5,null,null,Or rather Martin was mingled with it
6,null,null,absorbed in it
7,null,null,part of it
8,null,null,and she was there too sharing with him the very action of the story .
1053 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,You know me better than any of them do and I am just as you know me
2,null,null,every bit
3,anger,angry,The aunts are very angry because they say I deceived them
4,null,null,but they have n't any right to tell me who I shall love
5,null,null,have they
6,null,null,No one has
7,null,null,I am myself and nobody 's ever cared for me except you and Uncle Mathew
8,null,null,so I dont see why I should think of anybody .

5,null,null,Their joy on this meeting was very great
6,null,null,as well it might
7,null,null,since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years
8,null,null,Compliments on good looks now passed
9,null,null,and

11,null,null,how little they had thought of meeting in Bath

5,null,null,etc
6,happiness,pleasure,which Catherine heard with pleasure
7,null,null,and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command

9,null,null,as the first proof of amity

8,happiness,satisfied,never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs Thorpe
9,null,null,in what they called conversation

8,null,null,indeed
9,null,null,I should not
10,null,null,I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him

12,null,null,I feel as if nobody could make me miserable
13,null,null,The dreadful black veil
14,null,null,My dear Isabella

1,null,null,"  He is as good natured a fellow as ever lived
2,null,null,a little of a rattle
3,null,null,but that will recommend him to your sex

5,null,null,"    "  Very
6,null,null,very much indeed :  Isabella particularly
7,null,null,"  I am very glad to hear you say so

10,null,null,and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable
11,null,null,I always wanted you to know her
12,null,null,and she seems very fond of you

2431 19
 (13, 7),
1,null,null,Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude
2,null,null,and they continued as they were for three minutes longer
3,null,null,when Isabella
4,null,null,who had been talking to James on the other side of her
5,null,null,turned again to his sister and whispered
6,null,null,"  My dear creature
7,null,null,I am afraid I must leave you
8,null,null,your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin
9,null,null,I know you will not mind my going away

11,null,null,and then you may easily find me out
12,null,null,Catherine
13,sadness,disappointed,though a little disappointed
14,null,null,had too much good nature to make any opposition

17,null,null,"  good bye

2,null,null,her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home
3,null,null,It was ages since she had had a moment 's conversation with her dearest Catherine
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,though she had such thousands of things to say to her
6,null,null,it appeared as if they were never to be together again
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,with sniffles of most exquisite misery
9,sadness,despondency,and the laughing eye of utter despondency
10,null,null,she bade her friend adieu and went on .

5,null,null,I had not even brought any books to read
6,null,null,nothing to distract me
7,null,null,Just me and my mind
8,null,null,about to face each other on an empty field
9,null,null,I remember that my legs were visibly shaking with fear
10,null,null,Then I quoted to myself one of my favorite lines ever from my Guru :   "  Fear who cares

6,null,null,But their father
7,null,null,though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure
8,happiness,glad,was really glad to see them
9,null,null,he had felt their importance in the family circle
10,null,null,The evening conversation
11,null,null,when they were all assembled
12,null,null,had lost much of its animation

2,null,null,however

7,null,null,quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book
8,null,null,which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his
9,null,null,she gave a great yawn and said
10,null,null,"  How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way
11,null,null,I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading
