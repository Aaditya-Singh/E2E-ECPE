7,sadness,with despair in his heart,with despair in his heart
8,null,null,followed the movements of the cards
9,null,null,which were passing from hand to hand
10,null,null,and fast approaching him again

431 9
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Clients became so numerous that Pascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre
2,null,null,and his rent was consequently doubled
3,null,null,but the income he derived from his profession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs safely invested as a resource against any emergency
4,null,null,Madame Ferailleur now laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband 's death
5,null,null,She felt that she owed it to Pascal
6,null,null,and

1,null,null,Meanwhile Madame Ferailleur and her son had exchanged significant glances
2,null,null,Their impressions were the same
3,null,null,This man could not be an enemy
4,null,null,When the baron had finished his letter
5,null,null,and had read it aloud
6,null,null,Pascal
7,null,null,who was deeply moved
8,null,null,exclaimed :   "  I do not know how to express my gratitude to you
9,null,null,monsieur

11,null,null,pray dont send that note
12,fear,annoyance,It would cause you a great deal of trouble and annoyance

447 7
 (3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,The doctor was expecting something very different
2,null,null,but nevertheless he replied with all due gravity and self possession
3,sadness,painful,"  It is my painful duty to tell you
4,null,null,madame
5,null,null,that there is scarcely any hope
6,null,null,and that I expect a fatal termination within twenty-four hours

6,null,null,but about his papers
7,null,null,He locked them up with the greatest care
8,fear,feared,as if he feared that some terrible secret might evaporate from them
9,null,null,It was a mania with him
10,null,null,If he had a letter to write
11,null,null,he barricaded his door
12,null,null,as if he were about to commit some horrible crime
13,null,null,More than once have I seen him   "   The words died away on her lips
14,null,null,and she remained motionless and abashed
15,null,null,like a person who has just escaped some great peril
16,null,null,One word more
17,null,null,and involuntarily
18,null,null,without even knowing it
19,null,null,she would have confessed her besetting sin
20,null,null,which was listening at
21,null,null,and peering through
22,null,null,the keyholes of the doors that were closed against her .

 (9, 9),
1,null,null,a miserable foundling
2,null,null,reared by public charity for the generosity which this good gentleman and lady showed in offering to take charge of me and employ me in their workshop I must confess that I could not clearly realize in what this great generosity which he so highly praised consisted
3,null,null,nor did I perceive any reason why I should be particularly grateful Still
4,null,null,to all the conditions imposed upon me
5,null,null,I answered
6,null,null,' yes

8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,greatly pleased,' so heartily that Madame Greloux seemed greatly pleased ' it is evident that the child will be glad to get away

11,null,null,repeating again and again that I was one of the very best girls in the asylum pious
12,null,null,obedient
13,null,null,and industrious
14,null,null,reading and writing to perfection
15,null,null,and knowing how to sew and embroider as only those who are taught in such institutions can

 (9, 9),
1,null,null,"  I timidly asked permission to return to my employers to inform them of what had happened and consult with them
2,null,null,but my request was refused
3,null,null,The superior told me that I must deliberate and decide alone
4,null,null,and that when once my decision was taken
5,null,null,there could be no change
6,null,null,So I remained at the asylum
7,null,null,and dined at the superior 's table
8,null,null,and during the night I occupied the room of a sister who was absent
9,surprise,surprised,What surprised me most of all was the deference with which I was treated
10,null,null,The sisters all seemed to consider me a person of great importance
11,null,null,And yet I hesitated .
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,null,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
474 8
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,Compelled to submit to this disappointment
2,null,null,he returned to the study
3,sadness,discouraged,but he was evidently discouraged
4,null,null,Although he did not consider the mystery insoluble
5,null,null,far from it
6,null,null,he realized that time and research would be required to arrive at a solution
7,null,null,and that the affair was quite beyond his province

6,null,null,What a hard
7,null,null,cold-hearted girl she was
8,null,null,Nevertheless for the moment he abandoned the subject .

6,sadness,disappointed,She had been honestly disappointed in her niece
7,null,null,disappointed in her plainness

 (4, 1),(4, 2),(4, 3),
1,null,null,When at last she found herself
2,null,null,a tiny figure

5,null,null,She rose to the waves of sound as a swimmer rises in the sea
6,null,null,her heart beat fast
7,null,null,and she was so eagerly engaged in looking about her
8,null,null,in staring at the hurrying people
9,null,null,in locating the shrill screams of the engines

4,null,null,even Martin
5,null,null,Or rather Martin was mingled with it
6,null,null,absorbed in it
7,null,null,part of it

3,null,null,for she feared that
4,null,null,no sooner had he left her
5,null,null,than the impression she had made on him would fade away
6,null,null,So she made one more effort to keep him

5,null,null,As for Mr
6,null,null,Henry Waterman
7,null,null,he was actually irritated by this defection .
1202 13
 (12, 13),
1,null,null,In spite of her fears and her uncertainty
2,null,null,Lillian Semple accepted his attentions and interest because
3,null,null,equally in spite of herself
4,null,null,she was drawn to him
5,null,null,One night
6,null,null,when she was going to bed
7,null,null,she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms
8,null,null,They were very pretty
9,null,null,A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long
10,null,null,peculiarly shaded hair
11,null,null,She thought of young Cowperwood
12,sadness,chilled,and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr
13,null,null,Semple and the force and quality of public opinion .
1208 6
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,She relapsed into additional protests

5,null,null,It was fine
6,null,null,advisable
7,null,null,practical
8,null,null,to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon
9,null,null,but if you had a sickly wife  And anyhow
10,null,null,was a man entitled to only one wife
11,null,null,Must he never look at another woman
12,null,null,Supposing he found some one
13,null,null,He pondered those things between hours of labor
14,null,null,and concluded that it did not make so much difference
15,null,null,If a man could
16,null,null,and not be exposed
17,null,null,it was all right
18,null,null,He had to be careful
19,null,null,though
20,null,null,Tonight
21,null,null,as he sat on the side of his wife 's bed
22,null,null,he was thinking somewhat of this
23,null,null,for he had seen Aileen Butler again
24,null,null,playing and singing at her piano as he passed the parlor door
25,null,null,She was like a bright bird radiating health and enthusiasm a reminder of youth in general .

11,null,null,oh
12,null,null,what was the use of complaining
13,null,null,They would never get anywhere with her father and mother in charge
14,null,null,She would just have to wait

2,null,null,its beauty and subtlety
3,null,null,to his material disadvantage
4,happiness,happy,he found a happy mean
5,null,null,owing to the swiftness of his intellectual operations
6,null,null,whereby he could
7,null,null,intellectually and emotionally
8,null,null,rejoice in the beauty of life without interfering with his perpetual material and financial calculations
9,null,null,And when it came to women and morals
10,null,null,which involved so much relating to beauty
11,null,null,happiness
12,null,null,a sense of distinction and variety in living
13,null,null,he was but now beginning to suspect for himself at least that apart from maintaining organized society in its present form there was no basis for this one life
14,null,null,one love idea .
1286 25
 (12, 10),
1,null,null,At the same time
2,null,null,in contemplating his wife in connection with all this he had many qualms
3,null,null,some emotional
4,null,null,some financial
5,null,null,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
6,null,null,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
7,null,null,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton
8,null,null,And yet
9,null,null,as he had also learned
10,null,null,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
11,null,null,This irritated Cowperwood
12,anger,irritate,as it would always irritate any strong
13,null,null,acquisitive
14,null,null,direct seeing temperament
15,null,null,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
16,null,null,why should there be concealment between them
17,null,null,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
18,null,null,Why do one thing and think another
19,null,null,To be sure
20,null,null,she was devoted to him in her quiet way
21,null,null,not passionately ( as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that )
22,null,null,but intellectually
23,null,null,Duty
24,null,null,as she understood it
25,null,null,played a great part in this .

1,null,null,She knew it was he
2,null,null,without turning
3,null,null,He came beside her
4,null,null,and she looked up smiling
5,null,null,the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishing  or melting into another mood
6,null,null,Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers
7,null,null,His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch
8,null,null,She stopped playing and tried to catch her breath
9,null,null,for
10,null,null,strong as she was
11,null,null,it affected her breathing
12,happiness,her heart was beating like a trip hammer,her heart was beating like a trip hammer
13,null,null,She did not say
14,null,null,"  Oh
15,null,null,"   or
16,null,null,"  You must n't
17,null,null,"   but rose and walked over to a window
18,null,null,where she lifted a curtain
19,null,null,pretending to look out
20,null,null,She felt as though she might faint
21,null,null,so intensely happy was she .
1290 7

3,null,null,and his manner expressed so much more good feeling
4,happiness,confidence,confidence

1,happiness,intoxicated,This intoxicated him
2,null,null,for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long contemplated dream that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line
3,null,null,issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public
4,null,null,using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way
5,null,null,In short
6,null,null,he was one of those early

5,null,null,but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him
6,null,null,all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us

16,null,null,clothed in a purple cloak
17,null,null,with a coif broidered with gold
18,null,null,and with his hair bound up
19,null,null,he went against the enemy trusting not in arms

7,null,null,Why the fact is
8,null,null,you see
9,null,null,Miss
10,null,null,this here ought to have been a RED rose tree
11,null,null,and we put a white one in by mistake

21,null,null,called out  The Queen
22,null,null,The Queen
23,null,null,' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  .  There was a sound of many footsteps
24,null,null,and Alice looked round
25,null,null,eager to see the Queen  .  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs
26,null,null,these were all shaped like the three gardeners
27,null,null,oblong and flat
28,null,null,with their hands and feet at the corners :  next the ten courtiers
29,null,null,these were ornamented all over with diamonds
30,null,null,and walked two and two
31,null,null,as the soldiers did
2070 23
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,And the Gryphon added  Come
2,null,null,let 's hear some of YOUR adventures
3,null,null,I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
4,null,null,' said Alice a little timidly :   but it 's no use going back to yesterday
5,null,null,because I was a different person then
6,null,null,Explain all that
7,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle No

10,null,null,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone :   explanations take such a dreadful time
11,fear,nervous,So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first
12,null,null,the two creatures got so close to her
13,null,null,one on each side
14,null,null,and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide
15,null,null,but she gained courage as she went on . Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  YOU ARE OLD
16,null,null,FATHER WILLIAM
17,null,null,' to the Caterpillar
18,null,null,and the words all coming different
19,null,null,and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath
20,null,null,and said  That 's very curious
21,null,null,It 's all about as curious as it can be
22,null,null,' said the Gryphon It all came different

2077 23
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,There was an eager pressing round to hear
2,null,null,and not only were Lilias and Malcolm
3,null,null,but old Sir David himself
4,null,null,much affected by the strain
5,null,null,which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III
6,null,null,which
7,null,null,sad as they were
8,null,null,now seemed like good old times
9,null,null,so much worse was the present state of affairs
10,null,null,Sir James
11,null,null,however

15,null,null,ballad
16,null,null,and lay
17,null,null,the evening passed away
18,null,null,till the parting cup was sent round
19,null,null,and the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep
20,null,null,in a wainscoted box bedstead
21,null,null,and his two attendant squires
22,null,null,a great iron gray Scot and a rosy honest faced Englishman

1,null,null,Yet he was reluctant to break with the old habits that had hitherto been part of his nature
2,null,null,he felt
3,null,null,after every word of Esclairmonde nay
4,null,null,after every glance towards her as though it were a blessed thing to have
5,null,null,like her
6,null,null,chosen the better part
7,null,null,he knew she would approve his resort to the home of piety and learning
8,sadness,ashamed,he was aware that when with Ralf Percy and the other youths of the Court he was ashamed of his own scrupulousness
9,null,null,and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and unmanly
10,null,null,and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic might not seize him and disgrace him for ever
11,null,null,In effect he did not know what he wished
12,null,null,even when he found that the Queen had decided against going across the sea
13,null,null,and that therefore all the ladies would remain with her at Shene or Windsor .

2,null,null,had almost lost his lameness
3,null,null,and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue
4,null,null,His nerves had become less painfully sensitive
5,null,null,and when after his first skirmish
6,null,null,during which he had kept close to King James
7,null,null,far too much terrified to stir an inch from him
8,null,null,he had not only found himself perfectly safe
9,null,null,but had been much praised for his valour
10,null,null,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,what with use
13,null,null,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,null,null,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,null,null,Perhaps
16,null,null,indeed
17,null,null,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,null,null,in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward

1,null,null,To this the deputies consented
2,null,null,and the next day was fixed for the surrender
3,null,null,The difficulty was
4,null,null,as Henry had found at Harfleur
5,null,null,Rouen
6,null,null,and many other places
7,null,null,to enforce forbearance on his soldiery
8,null,null,who regarded plunder as their lawful prey
9,null,null,the enemy as their natural game
10,null,null,and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmerciful ness
11,null,null,The more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of English country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of men-at-arms
12,null,null,the mere greedy
13,null,null,rapacious
14,null,null,and insubordinate became their temper
15,null,null,Well knowing the greatness of the peril
16,null,null,and that the very best of his captains had scarcely the will
17,null,null,if they had the power
18,null,null,to restrain the license that soon became barbarity unimaginable
19,sadness,sadly,he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender
20,null,null,when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his escutcheon
21,null,null,but a shame to human nature
22,null,null,looking back to the exultation with which he had entered Harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness .

8,null,null,there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority
9,null,null,since the King had promised to take cognizance of the case
