6,null,null,the departure in the cab
7,null,null,the night when she had sat at her aunt 's bedside that had given glimpses of the kind human creature Aunt Anne might have been had she never heard of the Inside Saints .
1067 8
 (7, 1),(7, 2),(7, 3),
1,null,null,She had not been certain
2,null,null,all this time
3,null,null,whether the aunts meant to take her to the service with them
4,null,null,She had supposed that her introduction to the meeting at Miss Avies 's meant that they intended to include her in this too
5,null,null,but now
6,null,null,as the evening advanced
7,fear,terror,in a fit of nervous terror she prayed within herself that they would not take her
8,null,null,If the end of the world were coming she would like to meet it in her bed .
1085 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Maggie rebuked herself for thinking this
2,null,null,but again and again the thought arose

4,surprise,amazed,everything amazed her
5,null,null,You would not think to look at her flat broad placidity that she was a creature of excitement
6,null,null,and it might be that her excitement was rather superficial
7,null,null,She would say :   "  Why
8,null,null,Just fancy

7,null,null,He was like a large friendly brother
1093 7

2,null,null,and one day suddenly
3,surprise,surprise,to his own surprise
4,null,null,when they were alone in the drawing-room

6,null,null,a most chaste kiss
7,null,null,gently on the forehead .
1108 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She was bored with them all
2,null,null,the Choir practices

5,null,null,and the rest
6,happiness,pleased,she was only too pleased that Maggie should do the hard work it was quite fair that she
7,null,null,Grace
8,null,null,should have a rest
9,null,null,At the same time she did not at all want to surrender the power that doing these things had given her .

 (4, 3),

8,null,null,and after all my display
9,null,null,I had to take the Curate ( whose name

8,null,null,-  "  Carrie darling
9,null,null,I was a proud man when I led you down the aisle of the church on our wedding day
10,null,null,that pride will be equalled

6,null,null,Lupin
7,null,null,He answered :    "  Well
8,null,null,Daisy is a splendid girl
9,null,null,but I was obliged to take her old fool of a father down a peg
10,null,null,What with his meanness over his cigars
11,null,null,his stinginess over his drinks
12,null,null,his farthing economy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second
13,null,null,writing to one on half sheets of notepaper
14,null,null,sticking the remnant of the last cake of soap on to the new cake
15,null,null,putting two bricks on each side of the fireplace
16,null,null,and his general ' outside-halfpenny ' business
17,null,null,' I was compelled to let him have a bit of my mind

 (4, 6),
1,null,null,In the midst of this early work he married Mrs
2,null,null,Semple

5,null,null,fearsome of public opinion
6,null,null,His family did not entirely approve
7,null,null,She was too old
8,null,null,his mother and father thought
9,null,null,and then Frank

16,null,null,not true
17,null,null,His brothers
18,null,null,Joseph and Edward
19,null,null,were interested
20,null,null,but not certain as to what they actually thought
21,null,null,since Mrs
22,null,null,Semple was good-looking and had some money .
1217 13
 (11, 10),
1,null,null,And Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood
3,null,null,in spite of the difference in their years
4,null,null,appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time
5,null,null,She was once awakened

8,null,null,responsive
9,null,null,dreamy
10,null,null,His mood and hers was for a baby
11,happiness,happy,and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her
12,null,null,She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself
13,null,null,and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so .
1242 18
 (14, 2),
1,null,null,Aileen always reminded Cowperwood of a high stepping horse without a check rein
2,null,null,He met her at various times
3,null,null,shopping with her mother

8,null,null,Oh
9,null,null,dear
10,null,null,Life is so tiresome

15,null,null,Cowperwood took her mental measurement exactly
16,null,null,A girl with a high sense of life in her
17,null,null,romantic
18,null,null,full of the thought of love and its possibilities .
1258 7
 (7, 7),

1279 38
 (26, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident
3,null,null,in so many ways
4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then
18,null,null,O Heavens
19,null,null,the palaver
20,null,null,What beatings of tom-toms
21,null,null,What mouthings of pharisaical moralities platitudes
22,null,null,Run now

25,null,null,It made him smile
26,anger,hypocrisy,Such hypocrisy
27,null,null,Such cant
28,null,null,Still
29,null,null,so the world was organized
30,null,null,and it was not for him to set it right
31,null,null,Let it wag as it would
32,null,null,The thing for him to do was to get rich and hold his own to build up a seeming of virtue and dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing
33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit
35,null,null,And he had these
36,null,null,"  I satisfy myself
37,null,null,"   was his motto
38,null,null,and it might well have been emblazoned upon any coat of arms which he could have contrived to set forth his claim to intellectual and social nobility .

7,null,null,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
8,null,null,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton .
1294 17
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,for the time being there was lovemaking
2,null,null,the usual billing and cooing of lovers in a simple and much less than final fashion
3,null,null,and the lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching spring were idyllic
4,null,null,Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such as he fancied
5,null,null,in the blush of this new desire
6,null,null,he had never experienced before
7,null,null,Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had first called on her in North Front Street

6,anger,condemned,talking of those men who now stand condemned for murdering the King
7,null,null,he says that he believes
8,null,null,that

 (8, 8),
1,null,null,For the first quarter of an hour
2,null,null,in spite of the September chill

9,null,null,I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way .
1731 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
2,null,null,having been absent only two hours
3,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals
4,null,null,Not one of the crew had ever seen or heard of such fishing before
5,happiness,pride,so my pride and pleasure may he imagined
6,null,null,A little learning may be a dangerous thing at times
7,null,null,but it certainly is often handy to have about you .
1734 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle

1748 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,annoyed,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders
7,null,null,Great was our delight at the news .
1750 9
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,But he gradually returned to his old self
2,happiness,relief,to my great relief
3,null,null,and I ventured somewhat timidly to remind him of the esteem in which he was held by all hands
4,null,null,even the skipper
5,null,null,I ventured to say
6,null,null,respected him
7,null,null,although
8,null,null,from some detestable form of ill humour

5,null,null,At last
6,disgust,tired,getting very tired of this  "  Portuguese Parliament "   of all talkers and no listeners
7,null,null,I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in
8,null,null,The harpooner s and other petty officers were grouped in the waist
9,null,null,earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales .
1773 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
2,null,null,but now
3,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
5,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
6,null,null,having been absent only two hours
7,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1801 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Next day
2,null,null,and for a whole week after
3,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work

5,surprise,amazing,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
1810 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,they were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed
2,null,null,My democratic sentiments are deeply seated
3,null,null,but I do believe in authority
4,null,null,and respect for it being rigidly enforced
5,null,null,so this uncalled for scene upset me
6,fear,anxious,making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson
7,null,null,They got one .
1819 14
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,And still the whale kept going steadily down
2,null,null,down
3,null,null,down
4,null,null,Already he was on the second boat 's lines
5,null,null,and taking them out faster than ever
6,null,null,Had we been alone
7,null,null,this persistence on his part
8,disgust,annoying,though annoying
9,null,null,would not have mattered much
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,with so many others in company
12,null,null,the possibilities of complication
13,null,null,should we need to slip our end
14,null,null,were numerous .
1820 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In this optimistic mood
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,I gaily flung myself into my place in the mate 's boat one morning
4,null,null,as we were departing in chase of a magnificent cachalot that had been raised just after breakfast
5,happiness,satisfaction,There were no other vessels in sight much to our satisfaction  the wind was light
6,null,null,with a cloudless sky
7,null,null,and the whale was dead to leeward of us
8,null,null,We sped along at a good rate towards our prospective victim
9,null,null,who was
10,null,null,in his leisurely enjoyment of life
11,null,null,calmly lolling on the surface
12,null,null,occasionally lifting his enormous tail out of water and letting it fall flat upon the surface with a boom audible for miles .
1829 9

1,null,null,The ceaseless motion of the vessel rocking at the centre of a circular space of blue
2,null,null,with a perfectly symmetrical dome of azure enclosing her above
3,null,null,un flecked by a single cloud
4,null,null,becomes at last almost unbearable from its changeless sameness of environment
5,null,null,Were it not for the trivial round and common task of everyday ship duty
6,null,null,some of the crew must become idiotic
7,null,null,or
8,anger,rage,in sheer rage at the want of interest in their lives
9,null,null,commit mutiny .

3,null,null,and sea all shimmering in an enchanted haze
4,null,null,and silence scarcely broken by the tender ripple of the gently parted waters before the boat 's steady keel though these joys have all been lost to me
5,null,null,and I in  "  populous city pent "   endure the fading years
6,null,null,I would not barter the memory of them for more than I can say
7,happiness,sweet,so sweet it is to me
8,null,null,And
9,null,null,then
10,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable
11,null,null,so free from anything to regret .
1854 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Before we left finally for New Zealand
2,null,null,every one of those Kanakas was as much at home in the whale boats as he would have been in a canoe
3,null,null,Of course they were greatly helped by their entire familiarity with the water
4,fear,dread,which took from them all that dread of being drowned which hampers the white  "  greenie "   so sorely
5,null,null,besides which
6,null,null,the absolute confidence they had in our prowess amongst the whales freed them from any fear on that head .
1862 12

1,null,null,There were sixteen white men on board the CHANCE
2,null,null,including the skipper
3,null,null,drawn as usual from various European and American sources
4,null,null,the rest of her large crew of over forty all told being made up of Maories and half-breeds
5,null,null,One common interest united them
6,null,null,making them the most jolly crowd I ever saw their devotion to their commander
7,null,null,There was here to be found no jealousy of the Maories being officers and harpooner s
8,null,null,no black looks or discontented murmuring
9,happiness,satisfied,all hands seemed particularly well satisfied with their lot in all its bearings
10,null,null,so that
11,null,null,although the old tub was malodorous enough to turn even a pretty strong stomach
12,null,null,it was a leasure to visit her cheerful crowd for the sake of their enlivening society .

 (9, 9),
1,null,null,however
2,null,null,showed no sign of doing so
3,null,null,although they all neared
4,null,null,with an accelerated drift
5,null,null,that point from whence no seamanship could deliver them
6,null,null,and where death inevitable
7,null,null,cruel
8,null,null,awaited them without hope of escape
9,fear,dangerous,The part of the coast upon which they were apparently driving was about as dangerous and impracticable as any in the world
10,null,null,A gigantic barrier of black
11,null,null,naked rock
12,null,null,extending for several hundred yards
13,null,null,rose sheer from the sea beneath
14,null,null,like the side of an ironclad
15,null,null,up to a height of seven or eight hundred feet .

2,null,null,when
3,surprise,surprise,to surprise me
4,null,null,the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us
5,null,null,They had gone out of the lake at its northern end
6,null,null,paddled into
7,null,null,and then up the Kagera to where we stood
8,null,null,showing
9,null,null,by actual navigation
10,null,null,the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon .
1908 33
 (22, 2),
1,null,null,About a year later
2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person
10,null,null,not obstreperously so
11,null,null,but quietly and under the surface
12,null,null,Business was a great urge
13,null,null,He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars
14,null,null,Then this cold nine more days of pneumonia and he was dead
15,null,null,The shoe store was closed for a few days
16,null,null,the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people
17,null,null,There was a funeral
18,null,null,with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church
19,null,null,to which they belonged
20,null,null,and then he was buried

22,sadness,cried bitterly,Semple cried bitterly
23,null,null,The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state
24,null,null,A brother of hers
25,null,null,David Wiggin
26,null,null,undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her
27,null,null,There was no will
28,null,null,but in the final adjustment
29,null,null,which included the sale of the shoe business
30,null,null,there being no desire on anybody 's part to contest her right to all the property
31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house
33,null,null,and was considered a charming and interesting widow .
1912 18
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Either the well was very deep
2,null,null,or she fell very slowly
3,null,null,for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next  .  First
4,null,null,she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to
5,null,null,but it was too dark to see anything
6,null,null,then she looked at the sides of the well
7,null,null,and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves
8,null,null,here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  .  She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed
9,null,null,it was labelled ' ORANGE MARMALADE '
10,surprise,to her great disappointment,but to her great disappointment it was empty :  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
11,null,null,so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  Well
12,null,null,' thought Alice to herself
13,null,null,after such a fall as this
14,null,null,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
15,null,null,How brave they 'll all think me at home
16,null,null,Why
17,null,null,I would n't say anything about it
18,null,null,even if I fell off the top of the house
1928 13
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,When the cage stopped
2,null,null,I found myself on a ridge of rock
3,null,null,and below me
4,null,null,the chasm
5,null,null,taking a slanting direction
6,null,null,shot down to a considerable depth
7,null,null,the darkness of which my lamp could not have penetrated
8,null,null,But through it
9,happiness,surprise,to my infinite surprise
10,null,null,streamed upward a steady brilliant light
11,null,null,Could it be any volcanic fire

1,null,null,Shmuel reached down and lifted the base of the fence
2,null,null,but it only lifted to a certain height and Bruno had no choice but to roll under it
3,null,null,getting his striped pyjamas completely covered in mud as he did so
4,null,null,He laughed when he looked down at himself
5,null,null,He had never been so filthy in all his life and it felt wonderful

2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,null,null,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,null,null,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,null,null,and as it was perfectly round
4,null,null,she found this a very difficult question  .  However

22,null,null,The Queen
23,null,null,' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  .  There was a sound of many footsteps
24,null,null,and Alice looked round
25,null,null,eager to see the Queen  .  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs
26,null,null,these were all shaped like the three gardeners
27,null,null,oblong and flat
28,null,null,with their hands and feet at the corners :  next the ten courtiers
29,null,null,these were ornamented all over with diamonds
30,null,null,and walked two and two
31,null,null,as the soldiers did

1,fear,anxiety,And for all Malcolm 's anxiety for his uncle
2,null,null,his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self respect .

1,null,null,Malcolm
2,sadness,ashamed,ashamed to say he was royal
3,null,null,but surprised at the patronage
4,null,null,was gratefully following
5,null,null,when old Bairdsbrae indignantly laid his hand on the rein
6,null,null,' not so
7,null,null,Sir
8,null,null,this is no place for you
2087 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The girl was as shy as a fawn
2,fear,frightened,frightened at every word from knight or lady
3,null,null,and much in awe of her future mother-in-law
4,null,null,a stiff and stately dame
5,null,null,with all the Beaufort haughtiness
6,null,null,so that Lady Westmoreland gladly and graciously consented to the offer of the Demoiselle de Luxemburg to attend to the little maiden
7,null,null,and let her share her chamber and her bed .
2089 25
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,' lo you now
2,null,null,Sir Richard
3,null,null,' said Henry
4,null,null,with a playful face of disgust
5,null,null,' this is to save your dainty meats
6,null,null,by spoiling my appetite by that unwelcome sight
7,null,null,What
8,null,null,man
9,null,null,have you bought up all the bonds I gave in my need to a whole synagogue of Jews and bench of loin bards
10,null,null,I shall have to send for my crown before you let me go

16,null,null,Sir Richard

 (10, 7),(10, 10),
1,null,null,And on this day
2,null,null,when Esclairmonde herself had arrayed the fair child in the dainty iest of rose pink bodices edged with swan ' s-down
3,null,null,the whitest of kirtle
4,null,null,and softest of rosy veils
5,null,null,the flush of anxiety on the pale little face made it so fair to look upon
6,null,null,that as the maiden wistfully asked
7,null,null,' think you he will flout me
8,null,null,' it was impossible not to laugh at the very notion
9,null,null,' ah

1,null,null,The idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful
2,null,null,refined
3,null,null,conscientious man through the earlier times of the Reformation
4,null,null,glad of the hope of cleansing the Church
5,null,null,but hoping to cleanse
6,null,null,not to break away from her a hope that Luther himself long cherished
7,null,null,and which was not entirely frustrated till the re assembly at Trent in the next generation
8,fear,feared,Justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the one body to which the promises were made
9,null,null,Their loyalty has been treated as blindness
10,null,null,timidity
11,null,null,or superstition
12,null,null,but that there were many such persons
13,null,null,and those among the very highest minds of their time
14,null,null,no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony
15,null,null,of Erasmus
16,null,null,of Vittoria Colonna
17,null,null,or of Cardinal Giustiniani .
2105 14
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,The words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation
2,null,null,the stranger to Christina 's ears
3,null,null,because intercourse with foreign merchants
4,null,null,and a growing affectation of Latin ism
5,null,null,had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed
6,surprise,surprised,and she was surprised to perceive by her father 's gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the castle
7,null,null,She looked up
8,null,null,and saw on the pathway above her a tall
9,null,null,large framed young man
10,null,null,his skin dyed red with sun and wind
11,null,null,in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair
12,null,null,moustache
13,null,null,and beard
14,null,null,as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the other .
2107 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,For one brief week
2,happiness,happy,Esclairmonde and Alice were very happy in this secret hope
3,null,null,but at the end of that time the Bishop of Therouenne appeared
4,null,null,Esclairmonde had ventured to hope that the King 's influence
5,null,null,and likewise the fact that her intention was not to enrich one of the regular monastic orders
6,null,null,might lead him to lend a favourable ear to her scheme
7,null,null,but she was by no means prepared to find him already informed of the affair of the Dance of Death
8,null,null,and putting his own construction on it .
2110 24
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,Here were the malicious defraud ers of the hungry warriors
2,null,null,Down upon them flew the angry foragers
3,null,null,Soon the pretty tranquil scene was ringing with the oaths of the plundering and the cries of the plundered
4,null,null,the cattle were being driven off
5,null,null,the houses and farm yards rifled
6,null,null,blood was flowing
7,null,null,and what could not be carried off was burning
8,null,null,The search for the Armagnac prisoner had
9,null,null,however
10,null,null,relaxed after the first inquiry
11,null,null,and Malcolm
12,surprise,surprised,surprised that this had been forgotten
13,null,null,suddenly bethought him of the distinction he should secure by sending a valuable prize to Esclairmonde 's feet
14,null,null,He seized on an old man who had not been able to fly
15,null,null,and stood trembling and panting in a corner
16,null,null,and demanded where the sick man was
17,null,null,The old man pointed to a farmhouse
18,null,null,round which clouds of smoke were rolling
19,null,null,and Malcolm hurried into it
20,null,null,shouting
21,null,null,' dog of an Armagnac
22,null,null,come out
23,null,null,Yield
24,null,null,ere thou be burnt
2112 35
 (31, 29),(31, 30),
1,null,null,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy
2,null,null,summoned Sir Nigel to his side
3,null,null,closed his own visor
4,null,null,and called for water
5,null,null,then hung over the prisoner
6,null,null,anxious to prevent the first word from being broad Scotch
7,null,null,In the free air
8,null,null,some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life
9,null,null,and James at once said
10,null,null,' rendez vous
11,null,null,My Lord
12,null,null,' but he neither answered
13,null,null,nor was there meaning in his eyes
14,null,null,And James perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs
15,null,null,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,null,null,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms
17,null,null,He swooned again at the first attempt to lift him
18,null,null,and a hay cart having been left in the flight of the marauders
19,null,null,he was laid in it
20,null,null,and covered with the King 's cloak
21,null,null,to be conveyed to Corbeil
22,null,null,where James trusted to secure his life by personal intercession with Henry
23,null,null,He groaned heavily several times
24,null,null,but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way
25,null,null,and James and Sir Nigel kept on either side of the cart
26,null,null,ready to address him in French the first moment
27,null,null,having told the English that he was a prisoner of quality
28,null,null,who must be carefully conveyed to King James 's tent at Corbeil
29,null,null,Malcolm was not allowed to approach
30,null,null,lest he should be recognized
31,sadness,in an agony of shame and suspense,and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense
32,null,null,with very different feelings towards Patrick than those with which he had of late thought of him
33,null,null,or of his own promises
34,null,null,If Patrick died through this plundering raid
35,null,null,how should he ever face Lily
2119 30
 (14, 13),(14, 14),
1,null,null,Therewith she made a great difference in the aspect of the chamber
2,null,null,under the full sanction of the lords of the castle
3,null,null,Wolf
4,null,null,deer
5,null,null,and sheep skins abounded
6,null,null,and with these
7,null,null,assisted by her father and old Hatto
8,null,null,she tapestry ied the lower part of the bare grim walls
9,null,null,a great bear 's hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth
10,null,null,and cushions were made of these skins
11,null,null,and stuffed from Ursel 's stores of feathers
12,null,null,All these embellishments were watched with great delight by Ermentrude
13,null,null,who had never been made of so much importance
14,surprise,surprised,and was as much surprised as relieved by such attentions
15,null,null,She was too young and too delicate to reject civilization
16,null,null,and she let Christina braid her hair
17,null,null,bathe her
18,null,null,and arrange her dress
19,null,null,with sensations of comfort that were almost like health
20,null,null,To train her into occupying herself was however
21,null,null,as Christina soon found
22,null,null,in her present state
23,null,null,impossible
24,null,null,She could spin and sew a little
25,null,null,but hated both
26,null,null,and her clumsy
27,null,null,listless fingers only soiled and wasted Christina 's needles
28,null,null,silk
29,null,null,and lute strings
30,null,null,and such damage was not so easily remedied as in the streets of Ulm .

2,null,null,so utterly different from the shrill wrangling notes of all the other women he had known
3,surprise,surprise,took him by surprise
4,null,null,He was still sober enough to be subdued
5,null,null,almost cowed
6,null,null,by resistance of a description unlike all he had ever seen
7,null,null,his alarm at Christina 's superior power returned in full force
8,null,null,he staggered to the stairs
9,null,null,Christina rushed after him
10,null,null,closed the heavy door with all her force
11,null,null,fastened it inside
12,null,null,and would have sunk down to weep but for Ermentrude 's peevish wail of distress .

2,sadness,hurt,Joel was deeply hurt by his mothers words
