 (8, 1),
1,null,null,Their young women go naked
2,null,null,but the mothers suspend a little tail both before and behind
3,null,null,As the hair of the negro will not grow long
4,null,null,a barber might be dispensed with
5,null,null,were it not that they delight in odd fashions
6,null,null,and are therefore continually either shaving it off altogether
7,null,null,or else fashioning it after the most whimsical designs
8,disgust,headstrong,No people in the world are so proud and headstrong as the negroes
9,null,null,whether they be pastoral or agriculturalists .
108 7
 (7, 6),(7, 7),
1,null,null,Lines of traffic are the worst tracks ( there are no roads in the districts here referred to ) for a traveller to go upon
2,null,null,not only because the hospitality of the people has been damped by frequent communication with travellers
3,null,null,but
4,null,null,by intercourse with the semi civilised merchant
5,null,null,their natural honour and honesty are corrupted
6,null,null,their cupidity is increased
7,surprise,frighten,and the show of firearms ceases to frighten them .

 (7, 7),
1,null,null,and judging from the progressive state of the world
2,null,null,one is led to suppose that the African must soon either step out from his darkness
3,null,null,or be superseded by a being superior to himself
4,null,null,Could a government be formed for them like ours in India
5,null,null,they would be saved
6,null,null,but without it
7,fear,fear,I fear there is very little chance
8,null,null,for at present the African neither can help himself nor will he be helped about by others
9,null,null,because his country is in such a constant state of turmoil he has too much anxiety on hand looking out for his food to think of anything else
111 13
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,The slave in this new position finds himself much better off than he ever was in his life before
2,null,null,with this exception
3,null,null,that as a slave he feels himself much degraded in the social scale of society
4,null,null,and his family ties are all cut off from him probably his relations have all been killed in the war in which he was captured
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,after the first qualms have worn off
7,null,null,we find him much attached to his master
8,null,null,who feeds him and finds him in clothes in return for the menial services which he performs
9,null,null,In a few years after capture
10,happiness,confidence,or when  confidence has been gained by the attachment shown by the slave
11,null,null,if the master is a trader in ivory
12,null,null,he will intrust him with the charge of his stores
13,null,null,and send him all over the interior of the continent to purchase for him both slaves and ivory
113 15
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,on the march he is no better
2,null,null,If you give him a gun and some ammunition to protect him in case of emergencies
3,null,null,he will promise to save it
4,null,null,but forthwith expends it by firing it off in the air
5,null,null,and demands more
6,surprise,fear,else he will fear to venture amongst the  "  savages
7,null,null,Suppose you give him a box of bottles to carry
8,null,null,or a desk
9,null,null,or anything else that requires great care
10,null,null,and you caution him of its contents
11,null,null,the first thing he does is to commence swinging it round and round
12,null,null,or putting it topsy-turvy on the top of his head
13,null,null,when he will run off at a jog trot
14,null,null,singing and laughing in the most provoking manner
15,null,null,and thinking no more about it than if it were an old stone
114 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,On the 17th
2,null,null,after the anchor was cast
3,null,null,without a moment 's delay I went off to the British Consulate to see my old friend Colonel Rigby
4,happiness,delighted,He was delighted to see us
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,in anticipation of our arrival
7,null,null,had prepared rooms for our reception
8,null,null,that both Captain Grant and myself might enjoy his hospitality until arrangements could be made for our final start into the interior .
116 6
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Colonel Rigby
2,null,null,who had at heart as much as anybody the success of the expedition
3,null,null,materially assisted me in accomplishing my object that men accustomed to discipline and a knowledge of English honour and honesty should be enlisted
4,happiness,confidence,to give confidence to the rest of the men
5,null,null,and he allowed me to select from his boat 's crew any men I could find who had served as men-of-war
6,null,null,and had seen active service in India .
117 12
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,On my return to Zanzibar
2,null,null,the Brisk sailed for the Mauritius
3,null,null,but fortune sent Grant and myself on a different cruise
4,null,null,Sultan Majid
5,null,null,having heard that a slaver was lying at Pangani
6,happiness,anxious,and being anxious to show his good faith with the English
7,null,null,begged me to take command of one his vessels of war and run it down
8,null,null,Accordingly
9,null,null,embarking at noon
10,null,null,as soon as the vessel could be got ready
11,null,null,we lay to that night at Tombat
12,null,null,with a view of surprising the slaver next morning
118 13
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,We had a brave crew of young negroes to pull us
2,null,null,but
3,null,null,pull as they would
4,fear,feared,the current was so strong that we feared
5,null,null,if we persisted
6,null,null,we should be drawn into the broad Indian Ocean
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,changing our line
9,null,null,we bore into the little coralline island
10,null,null,Maziwa
11,null,null,where
12,null,null,after riding over some ugly coral surfs
13,null,null,we put in for the night .
120 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,They both knew Hindustani
2,null,null,but while Rahan 's services at sea had been short
3,happiness,intelligent,Baraka had served nearly all his life with Englishmen was the smartest and most intelligent negro I ever saw was invaluable to Colonel Rigby as a detector of slave traders
4,null,null,and enjoyed his confidence completely so much so
5,null,null,that he said
6,null,null,on parting with him
7,null,null,that he did not know where he should be able to find another man to fill his post .

122 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,wo taxes in five miles was a thing unheard of
2,null,null,and I heard no more about the matter
3,null,null,until Bombay in the evening told me how Sheikh Said
4,fear,fearing,fearing awkward consequences
5,null,null,had settled to give two dubuani
6,null,null,one being taken from his own store
7,null,null,Lion 's Claw also turned up again
8,null,null,getting his cloths of yesterday one more being added from the Sheikh 's stores and he was then advised to go off quietly
9,null,null,as I was a fire eater whom nobody dared approach after my orders had been issued .
123 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A very welcome packet of quinine and other medicines reached us here from Rigby
2,null,null,who
3,null,null,hearing our complaints that the Hottentots could only be kept alive by daily potions of brandy and quinine
4,fear,feared,feared our supplies were not enough
5,null,null,and sent us more .
124 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,At the advice of Musa
2,sadness,sorry,I sent Maula 's son off at night to tell the old chief how sorry I was to find the Arabs so hot-headed I could not even effect an arrangement with them
3,null,null,It was a great pity
4,null,null,for Manua Sera was so much liked by the Wanyamuezi
5,null,null,they would
6,null,null,had they been able
7,null,null,have done anything to restore him .

126 16
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Next day the non belligerent Arabs left in charge of the station
2,null,null,headed by my old friends Abdulla and Mohinna
3,null,null,came to pay their respects again
4,null,null,recognising in me
5,null,null,as they said
6,null,null,a  "  personification of their sultan
7,null,null,"   and therefore considering what they were doing only due to my rank
8,sadness,regretted,They regretted with myself that Snay was so hot-headed
9,null,null,for they themselves thought a treaty of peace would have been the best thing for them
10,null,null,for they were more than half ruined already
11,null,null,and saw no hope for the future
12,null,null,Then
13,null,null,turning to geography
14,null,null,I told Abdulla all I had written and lectured in England concerning his stories about navigators on the N'yanza
15,null,null,which I explained must be the Nile
16,null,null,and wished to know if I should alter it in any way :
127 13
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,27th and 28th
2,null,null,I now gave all my men presents for the severe trials they had experienced in the wilderness
3,null,null,forgetting
4,null,null,as I told them
5,null,null,the merciless manner in which they had plundered me
6,null,null,but as I have a trifle more in proportion
7,null,null,to the three sole remaining pagazis
8,null,null,because they had not finished their work
9,disgust,discontented,my men were all discontented
10,null,null,and wished to throw back their presents
11,null,null,saying I did not love them
12,null,null,although they were  "  permanents
13,null,null,"   as much as the  "  temporaries .  "
130 15
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,Her old mistress
2,null,null,she said
3,null,null,died well stricken in years
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,as she had succeeded her
6,null,null,the people of her country invited Singinya to marry her
7,null,null,because feuds had arisen about the rights of succession
8,null,null,and it was better a prince
9,null,null,whom they thought best suited by birth and good qualities
10,null,null,should head their warriors
11,null,null,and keep all in order
12,null,null,At that moment Singinya was out in the field fighting his enemies
13,null,null,and she was sure
14,null,null,when he heard I was here
15,sadness,sorry,that he would be very sorry he had missed seeing me .

 (9, 9),
1,null,null,He used to trade in ivory
2,null,null,on account of some Arabs at Zanzibar
3,null,null,On crossing Usui
4,null,null,he once had a fight with one of the chiefs of the country and killed him
5,null,null,but he got through all right
6,null,null,because the natives
7,null,null,after two or three of their number had been killed
8,null,null,dispersed
9,fear,feared,and feared to come near his musket again
10,null,null,He visited Uganda when the late king Sunna was living
11,null,null,and even traded Usoga
132 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Adding a little advice of his own
2,null,null,Sheikh Said pressed me to go on with the journey as fast as possible
3,disgust,accused,because all the Arabs had accused me of conspiring with Manua Sera
4,null,null,and would turn against me unless I soon got away .
133 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,He was a fine looking young man
2,null,null,about thirty years old
3,null,null,the husband of thirty wives
4,null,null,but he had only three children
5,surprise,surprised,Much surprised at the various articles composing our kit
6,null,null,he remarked that our  "  sleeping clothes "   blankets were much better than his royal robes
7,null,null,but of all things that amused him most were our picture books
8,null,null,especially some birds drawn by Wolf .
134 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,after being humbugged so many times by his procrastination
2,null,null,I gave Sheikh Said more letters and specimens
3,null,null,with orders to take the Tots down to the coast as soon as practicable
4,null,null,and started once more for the north
5,null,null,expecting very shortly to hear of Musa 's death
6,null,null,though he promised to follow me the very next day or die in the attempt
7,null,null,and he also said he would bring on the four men required by Suwarora
8,happiness,satisfied,for I was fully satisfied in my mind that he would have marched with me then had he had the resolution to do so at all .
135 9
 (3, 3),(5, 3),
1,null,null,but they came and went in the most tantalising manner
2,null,null,notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give
3,sadness,worse and worse,Every day seemed to be worse and worse
4,null,null,Some of Musa 's men came to get palm toddy for him
5,sadness,weak,as he was too weak  to stand
6,null,null,and was so cold nothing would warm him
7,null,null,There was
8,null,null,however
9,null,null,no message brought for myself
137 8
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,amused,My men had greatly amused him by firing their guns off and showing him the use of their sword bayonets
2,null,null,I knew
3,null,null,as a matter of course
4,null,null,that if I stopped any longer I should be teased for more cloths
5,null,null,and gave orders to my men to march the same instant
6,null,null,saying
7,null,null,if they did not for I saw them hesitate I would give the cows to the villagers
8,null,null,since I knew that was the thing that weighed on their minds .
138 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,This provoked fresh squabbles
2,null,null,The drums had beaten and the tax was settled
3,null,null,I could not pay more
4,null,null,The kirangozi
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,said he would not move a peg unless I gave something more
7,null,null,else he would be seized on his way back
8,null,null,His  "  children all said the same
9,sadness,worsted,and as I thought Grant would only be worsted if I did not keep friends with the scoundrel
10,null,null,I gave four yards more merikani
11,null,null,and then went on my way .
139 10
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,At length giving in
2,null,null,I entered Ruhe 's boma
3,null,null,the poles of which were decked with the skulls of his enemies stuck upon them
4,null,null,Instead
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,of seeing him myself
7,fear,feared,as he feared my evil eye
8,null,null,I conducted the arrangements for the hongo through Baraka
9,null,null,in the same way as I did at M'yonga 's
10,null,null,directing that it should be limited to the small sum of one barsati and four yards kiniki .
140 11
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,This was too provoking
2,fear,worry,The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever
3,null,null,and had made me feel quite sick
4,null,null,so I said
5,null,null,if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifer s again
6,null,null,I would fight the matter out with him
7,null,null,for I had not come there to be bullied
8,null,null,He then gave way
9,null,null,and begged I would allow my men to fire a volley outside his boma
10,null,null,as the Watuta were living behind a small line of granitic hills flanking the west of his district
11,null,null,and he wished to show them what a powerful force he had got with him .
142 11
 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Whilst engaged in this operation
2,null,null,Baraka
3,null,null,accompanied by Wadimoyo ( Heart ' s-stream )
4,null,null,another of my freeman
5,null,null,approached me in great consternation
6,null,null,whispering to themselves
7,fear,fearful,They said they had some fearful news to communicate
8,null,null,which
9,null,null,when I heard it
10,null,null,they knew would deter our progress :  it was of such great moment and magnitude
11,null,null,they thought they could not deliver it then .
144 14
 (14, 14),
1,null,null,This was a fearful drain on my store
2,null,null,but the Pig
3,null,null,seeing my concern
4,null,null,merely laughed at it
5,null,null,and said
6,null,null,"  Oh
7,null,null,these savage chiefs are all alike here
8,null,null,you will have one of these taxes to pay every stage to Uyofu
9,null,null,and then the heavy work will begin
10,null,null,for all these men
11,null,null,although they assume the dignity of chief to themselves
12,null,null,are mere officers
13,null,null,who have to pay tribute to Suwarora
14,anger,angry,and he would be angry if they were shortcoming .  "
145 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,These two slaves
2,null,null,both of whom knew all the chiefs and languages up to and including Uganda
3,null,null,promised me faithfully they would go with Bombay on to Usui
4,null,null,and bring back porters in sufficient number for Grant and myself to go on together
5,fear,terror,They laughed at the stories I told them of the terror that had seized Baraka and all the Wanguana
6,null,null,and told me
7,null,null,as old Musa had often done before
8,null,null,that those men
9,null,null,especially Baraka
10,null,null,had from their first leaving Kaze made up their minds they would not enter Usui
11,null,null,or go anywhere very far north .
146 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Then turning to the animals
2,null,null,he roared over each one in turn as he examined them
3,null,null,and called out their names
4,null,null,My bull ' s-eye lantern he coveted so much
5,anger,anger,I had to pretend exceeding anger to stop his further importune ties
6,null,null,He then began again begging for lucifer s
7,null,null,which charmed him so intensely I thought I should never get rid of him .
147 8
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,whilst in the valley there were not only magnificent trees of extraordinary height
2,null,null,but also a surprising amount of the richest cultivation
3,null,null,amongst which the banana may be said to prevail
4,null,null,Notwithstanding this apparent richness in the land
5,null,null,the Wanyambo
6,null,null,living in their small squalid huts
7,disgust,poor,seem poor
8,null,null,The tobacco they smoke is imported from the coffee growing country of Uhaiya .
149 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,Leaving the valley of Uthenga
2,null,null,we rose over the spur of N'yamwara
3,null,null,where we found we had attained the delightful altitude of 5000 odd feet
4,null,null,Oh
5,happiness,enjoyed,how we enjoyed it
6,null,null,every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika
7,null,null,Tripping down the greensward
8,null,null,we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley
9,null,null,and pitched our tents in the village .
151 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Ever anxious to push on with the journey
2,null,null,as I felt every day 's delay only tended to diminish my means that is
3,null,null,my beads and copper wire I instructed Bombay to take the under mentioned articles to Rumanika as a small sample of the products of my country
4,sadness,ashamed,to say I felt quite ashamed of their being so few and so poor
5,null,null,but I hoped he would forgive my shortcomings
6,null,null,as he knew I had been so often robbed on the way to him
7,null,null,and I trusted
8,null,null,in recollection of Musa
9,null,null,he would give me leave to go on to Uganda
10,null,null,for every day 's delay was consuming my supplies .
153 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Neither his father nor any of his forefathers had had such a great favour shown them
2,null,null,He was alarmed
3,null,null,he confessed
4,null,null,when he heard we were coming to visit him
5,null,null,thinking we might prove some fearful monsters that were not quite human
6,happiness,delighted,but now he was delighted beyond all measure with what he saw of us
7,null,null,A messenger should be sent at once to the king of Uganda to inform him of our intention to visit him
8,null,null,with his own favourable report of us .
155 12
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,Here some of the porters
2,null,null,attempting to bolt
3,null,null,were intercepted by my coast men and had a fight of it
4,null,null,for they fired arrows
5,null,null,and in return the coast men cut their bows
6,null,null,The whole camp
7,null,null,of course
8,null,null,was in a blaze at this
9,null,null,their tribe was insulted
10,disgust,not stand it,and they would not stand it
11,null,null,until Bombay put down their pride with a few strings of beads
12,null,null,as the best means of restoring peace in the camp .
156 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,At this place we were visited by the chief of the district
2,null,null,Pongo ( bush boc )
3,null,null,who had left his palace to see us and invite us his way
4,fear,feared,for he feared we might give him the slip by going west into Uyofu
5,null,null,He sent us a cow
6,null,null,and said he should like some return
7,null,null,for Masudi
8,null,null,who had gone ahead
9,null,null,only gave him a trifle
10,null,null,professing to be our vanguard
11,null,null,and telling him that as soon as we came with the large caravan we would satisfy him to his heart 's content .
157 12
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,It was given
2,null,null,after many angry words
3,null,null,but it was the old story over again  he would have one more wire and a cloth
4,null,null,or else he would not allow us to proceed on the morrow
5,null,null,My men
6,anger,provoked,this time really provoked
7,null,null,said they would fight it out
8,null,null,a king breaking his word in that way
9,null,null,But in the end the demand had to be paid
10,null,null,and at last
11,null,null,at 9 P
12,null,null,the drums beat the satisfaction .
158 10
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,Happily,Happily no one tried to pillage us here
2,null,null,so on we went to Vikora 's
3,null,null,another officer
4,null,null,living at N'yakasenye
5,null,null,under a sandstone hill
6,null,null,faced with a dyke of white quartz
7,null,null,over which leaped a small stream of water a seventy feet drop which
8,null,null,it is said
9,null,null,Suwarora sometimes paid homage to when the land was oppressed by drought
10,null,null,Vikora 's father it was whom Sirboko of Mininga shot .
160 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,On leaving this interesting place
2,null,null,with the widespread information of all the surrounding countries I had gained
3,null,null,my mind was so impressed with the topographical features of all this part of Africa
4,null,null,that in my heart I resolved I would make Rumanika as happy as he had made me
5,null,null,and asked K'yengo his doctor
6,null,null,of all things I possessed what the king would like best
7,surprise,surprise,To my surprise I then learnt that Rumanika had set his heart on the revolving rifle I had brought for Mtesa the one
8,null,null,in fact
9,null,null,which he had prevented my sending on to Uganda in the hands of Kachuchu
10,null,null,and he would have begged me for it before had his high-minded dignity
11,null,null,and the principle he had established of never begging for anything
12,null,null,not interfered .
161 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The flatterers said
2,null,null,"  It is as clear as possible
3,happiness,pleased,God gave the thunderbolt to Dagaro as a sign he was pleased with him and his rule
4,null,null,but when he found two brothers contending
5,null,null,he withdrew it to show their conduct was wicked .  "

1,null,null,n a minute or two afterwards
2,null,null,the good young princes
3,null,null,attracted by the sound of the gun

5,surprise,surprise,Their surprise knew no bounds
6,null,null,they could scarcely believe what they saw
7,null,null,and then
8,null,null,on recovering
9,null,null,with the spirit of true gentlemen
10,null,null,they seized both my hands
11,null,null,congratulating me on the magnitude of my success
12,null,null,and pointed out
13,null,null,as an example of it
14,null,null,a bystander who showed fearful scars
15,null,null,both on his abdomen and at the blade of his shoulder
16,null,null,who they declared had been run through by one of these animals .

 (15, 17),
1,null,null,heir surprise knew no bounds
2,null,null,they could scarcely believe what they saw
3,null,null,and then
4,null,null,on recovering
5,null,null,with the spirit of true gentlemen
6,null,null,they seized both my hands
7,null,null,congratulating me on the magnitude of my success

10,null,null,a bystander who showed fearful scars
11,null,null,both on his abdomen and at the blade of his shoulder
12,null,null,who they declared had been run through by one of these animals
13,null,null,It was
14,null,null,therefore
15,happiness,wonderful,wonderful to them
16,null,null,they observed
17,null,null,with what calmness I went up to such formidable beasts .
166 12
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,accused,In the evening we had another row with my head men Baraka having accused Bombay of trying to kill him with magic
2,null,null,Bombay
3,null,null,who was so incessantly bullied by Baraka 's officious attempts to form party cliques opposed to the interests of the journey
4,null,null,and get him turned out of the camp
5,null,null,indiscreetly went to one of K'yengo 's men
6,null,null,and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would affect the hearts of the Wanguana so as to incline them towards him
7,null,null,and on the sub doctor saying Yes
8,null,null,Bombay gave him some beads
9,null,null,and bought the medicine required
10,null,null,which
11,null,null,put into a pot of pombe
12,null,null,was placed by Baraka 's side .
168 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Some other travellers from the north again informed us that they had heard of Wanguana who attempted to trade in Gani and Chopi
2,null,null,but were killed by the natives
3,null,null,I now assured Rumanika that in two or three years he would have a greater trade with Egypt than he ever could have with Zanzibar
4,null,null,for when I opened the road
5,null,null,all those men he heard of would swarm up here to visit him
6,null,null,however
7,sadness,laughed,only laughed at my folly in proposing to go to a place of which all I heard was merely that every stranger who went there was killed
169 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,He began to show a disinclination to allow my going there
2,null,null,and though from the most friendly intention
3,null,null,this view was alarming
4,null,null,for one word from him could have ruined my projects
5,null,null,As it was
6,fear,feared,I feared my followers might take fright and refuse to advance with me
7,null,null,I thought it good policy to talk of there being many roads leading through Africa
8,null,null,so that Rumanika might see he had not got
9,null,null,as he thought
10,null,null,the sole key to the interior .
170 15
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Although
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,this very interesting people
4,null,null,the Wahuma
5,happiness,delight,delight in supposing themselves to be of European origin
6,null,null,they are forced to confess
7,null,null,on closer examination
8,null,null,that although they came in the first instance from the doubtful north
9,null,null,they came latterly from the east
10,null,null,as part of a powerful Wahuma tribe
11,null,null,beyond Kidi
12,null,null,who excel in arms
13,null,null,and are so fierce no Kidi people
14,null,null,terrible in war as these too are described to be
15,null,null,can stand against them .
171 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,after ordering all the seizures to be given up to Maula on behalf of the king
2,null,null,and threatening to discharge any of my men who dared retain one item of the property
3,null,null,I shut the door of my hut to do penance for two days
4,null,null,giving orders that nobody but my cook Ilmas
5,null,null,not even Bombay
6,null,null,should come near me
7,null,null,for the king had caused my men to sin had disgraced their red cloth and had inflicted on me a greater insult than I could bear
8,sadness,ashamed,I was ashamed to show my face
9,null,null,Just as the door was closed
10,null,null,other pages from the king brought the Whitworth rifle to be cleaned
11,null,null,and demanded an admittance
172 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,On Maula 's return
2,happiness,generous,I was told the king would not believe so generous a man as Bana could have sent him so few beads
3,null,null,he believed most of my store must have been stolen on the road
4,null,null,and would ask me about that to-morrow .
174 12
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,In a little while I felt tired of the monotony
2,null,null,and wished to hang up a curtain
3,null,null,that I might lie down in privacy and sleep till the king was ready
4,null,null,but the officers in waiting forbade this
5,null,null,as contrary to law
6,null,null,and left me the only alternative of walking up and down the court to kill time
7,null,null,spreading my umbrella against the powerful rays of the sun
8,null,null,A very little of that made me fidgety and impetuous
9,null,null,which the Waganda noticed
10,null,null,and
11,sadness,fear,from fear of the consequences
12,null,null,they began to close the gate to prevent my walking away .
176 11
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,at Anguza
3,null,null,"  Then you had two mothers and two fathers one set died at Anguja
4,null,null,and the other set at Anguza
5,null,null,you are a humbug
6,disgust,dont believe,I dont believe you
7,null,null,you are no Mguana
8,null,null,but a slave who has been snatched from his family
9,null,null,and does not know where any of his family are
10,null,null,ah
11,null,null,ah
177 17
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The first court passed
2,surprise,surprised,I was even more surprised to find the unusual ceremonies that awaited me
3,null,null,There courtiers of high dignity stepped forward to greet me
4,null,null,dressed in the most scrupulously neat fashions
5,null,null,Men
6,null,null,women
7,null,null,bulls
8,null,null,dogs
9,null,null,and goats
10,null,null,were led about by strings
11,null,null,cocks and hens were carried in men 's arms
12,null,null,and little pages
13,null,null,with rope turbans
14,null,null,rushed about
15,null,null,conveying messages
16,null,null,as if their lives depended on their swiftness
17,null,null,every one holding his skin cloak tightly round him lest his naked legs might by accident be shown .
178 12
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,but Ntalo wont be done
2,null,null,so retorts by saying
3,null,null,"  Sangizo
4,disgust,laugh,you may laugh at me because I am an orphan
5,null,null,but what are you
6,null,null,you are a savage a Mshezi
7,null,null,you come from the Mashenzi
8,null,null,and you wear skins
9,null,null,not cloths
10,null,null,as men do
11,null,null,so hold your impudent tongue "
12,null,null,and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again .
179 13
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,laugh,And all the men of the camp laugh together at the wretched Ntalo 's defeat
2,null,null,but Ntalo wont be done
3,null,null,so retorts by saying
4,null,null,"  Sangizo
5,null,null,you may laugh at me because I am an orphan
6,null,null,but what are you

9,null,null,and you wear skins
10,null,null,not cloths

12,null,null,so hold your impudent tongue "
13,null,null,and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again .
181 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,She admitted me at once
2,null,null,when I gave her quinine
3,null,null,on the proviso that I should stop there all day and night to repeat the dose
4,null,null,and tell her the reason why I did not come before
5,anger,anger,She affected great anger at Mtesa having interfered with my servants when coming to see her sympathised with me on the distance I had to travel ordered a hut to be cleared for me ere night told me to eat my breakfast in the next court and
6,null,null,rising abruptly
7,null,null,walked away
8,null,null,At noon we heard the king approaching with his drums and rattle traps
9,null,null,but I still waited on till 5 p
10,null,null,when
11,null,null,on summons
12,null,null,I repaired to the throne hut .
182 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,22d
2,null,null,To-day the king went the round of his relations
3,null,null,showing the beautiful things given him by the white man a clear proof that he was much favoured by the  "  spirits
4,null,null,"   for neither his father nor any of his forefathers had been so recognised and distinguished by any  "  sign "   as a rightful inheritor to the Uganda throne :  an anti-Christian interpretation of omens
5,null,null,as rife in these dark regions now as it was in the time of King Nebuchadnezzar
6,null,null,At midnight the three muskets were returned
7,happiness,pleased,and I was so pleased with the young king 's prompt attitude and honesty
8,null,null,I begged he would accept them .
184 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,And when the whole story was fully narrated
2,null,null,the matter was thought a good joke
3,null,null,After pausing a little
4,null,null,I asked the king what ailed him
5,sadness,sorry,for I was sorry to hear he had been sick
6,null,null,but instead of replying
7,null,null,he shook his head
8,null,null,as much as to say
9,null,null,I had put a very uncouth question to his majesty and ordered some men to shoot cows .
185 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Early in the morning
2,null,null,as I expected
3,null,null,she demanded my immediate attendance
4,null,null,and so the little diplomatic affair I had anticipated came on
5,null,null,I began the affair by intimating that I am in bed
6,null,null,and have not breakfasted
7,null,null,So at 10 a
8,null,null,another messenger arrives
9,surprise,surprised,to say her majesty is much surprised at my not coming
10,null,null,What can such conduct mean
11,null,null,when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire
12,null,null,that she might drink her medicine properly
186 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Instead of admiring this childish pastime
2,null,null,which in Uganda is considered royal sport
3,null,null,I rather looked disdainful
4,null,null,until
5,sadness,disappointed,apparently disappointed at my indifference
6,null,null,he asked what the box I had brought contained
7,null,null,On being told it was the medicine he desired
8,null,null,he asked me to draw near
9,null,null,and sent his courtiers away
10,null,null,When only the interpreters and one confidential officer were left
11,null,null,besides myself
12,null,null,he wished to know if I could apply the medicine without its touching the afflicted part .
187 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,What can such conduct mean
2,null,null,when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire
3,null,null,that she might drink her medicine properly
4,null,null,Still I am not up
5,fear,fear,but nobody will let me rest for fear of the queen
6,null,null,so
7,null,null,to while away the time
8,null,null,I order Bombay to call upon her
9,null,null,give the quinine
10,null,null,and tell her all that has happened
190 8
 (5, 5),(7, 5),
1,null,null,I now asked permission to speak with him on some important matters
2,null,null,when he sent his women away and listened
3,null,null,I said I felt anxious about the road on which Mabruki was travelling
4,null,null,to which I added that I had ordered him to tell Petherick to come here or else to send property to the value of one thousand dollars
5,fear,anxious,and I felt anxious because some of the queen 's officers felt doubtful about Waganda being able to penetrate Kidi
6,null,null,He said I need not concern myself on that score
7,fear,anxious,he was much more anxious for the white men to come here than even I was
8,null,null,and he would not send my men into any danger
191 17
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,He then thought of adjutant shooting with ball
2,null,null,left the court sitting
3,null,null,desired me to follow him
4,null,null,and leading the way
5,null,null,went into the interior of the palace
6,null,null,where only a few select officers were permitted to follow us
7,null,null,The birds were wild
8,null,null,and as nothing was done
9,null,null,I instructed him in the way to fire from his shoulder
10,null,null,placing the gun in position
11,null,null,He was shy at first
12,sadness,laughed,and all the people laughed at my handling royalty like a schoolboy
13,null,null,but he soon took to it very good naturedly
14,null,null,when I gave him my silk necktie and gold crest ring
15,null,null,explaining their value
16,null,null,which he could not comprehend
17,null,null,and telling him we gentlemen prided ourselves on never wearing brass or copper .
192 9
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,There was something in her manner when she said this that I did not like it looked suspicious
2,null,null,and I contented myself by saying
3,null,null,"  No
4,null,null,I am a wiser doctor than any in these lands
5,null,null,if anybody could cure you
6,null,null,that person is myself :  and further
7,null,null,if I gave you a goat to sacrifice
8,anger,angry,God would be angry with both of us for our superstitious credulity
9,null,null,you must therefore say no more about it .  "
194 8
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,So the four sang
2,null,null,each in turn
3,null,null,and died in the sight of some who pitied
4,null,null,and some who feared
5,anger,hated,and some who hated
6,null,null,for the sake of land and women
7,null,null,So the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw
8,null,null,and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river .
195 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There was no time to think
2,fear,fear,my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann
3,null,null,Just then I heard her calling out to me .
196 4
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light
2,null,null,now through one loophole and now through another
3,null,null,until a ray slanted from the western wall and rested upon the red-and-black paint of two dead bodies in the corner
4,fear,stared with horror,I stared with horror .
197 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Ye ought to hev seen the trash we turned back
2,null,null,Polly Ann
3,fear,scared,Most of ' em was scared plum crazy
4,null,null,and they was fer gittin ' out 'n Kaintuckee at any cost
5,null,null,Some was fer fighting ' their way through us
198 8
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,and ' what did ye say
2,null,null,'' demanded Polly Ann
3,null,null,pausing in her work
4,anger,her eyes flashing with resentment,her eyes flashing with resentment
5,null,null,Did ye tell ' em they was cowards to want to settle lands
6,null,null,and not fight for ' em
7,null,null,Other folks ' lands
8,null,null,too
199 14
 (6, 6),(13, 6),
1,null,null,The horse with the craning neck
2,null,null,the liveried servant at the bridle
3,null,null,the listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the horse block
4,null,null,and above him
5,null,null,under the portico
6,sadness,made me sad,the grand lady whose laugh had  made me sad
7,null,null,And I remembered
8,null,null,too
9,null,null,the wild
10,null,null,neglected lad who had been to me as a brother
11,null,null,warm-hearted and generous
12,null,null,who had shared what he had with a foundling
13,sadness,wept with me in my first great sorrow,who had wept with me in my first great sorrow
14,null,null,Where was he
202 10
 (10, 4),
1,null,null,No man east of the mountains knows the horror of that Indian warfare
2,null,null,This government gives them no protection now
3,null,null,Nay
4,null,null,Congress cannot even procure for them an outlet for their commerce
5,null,null,They must trade or perish
6,null,null,Spain closes the Mississippi
7,null,null,arrests our merchants
8,null,null,seizes their goods
9,null,null,and often throws them into prison
10,disgust,scorn,No wonder they scorn the Congress as weak and impotent
203 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion
2,null,null,Then he turned and walked away very slowly
3,disgust,shame,as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat
4,null,null,The young man flung away the fence rail
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers
7,null,null,he strode past me into the tavern
8,null,null,his anger still hot .
204 5
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,I fear that we are losing our heads
2,null,null,gentlemen
3,null,null,'' he said
4,null,null,and I propose to you the health of the first citizen of Kentucky
5,null,null,Colonel George Rogers Clark .
205 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,A fear that you were married
2,null,null,'' he said
3,null,null,with a boldness that made me blush
4,null,null,As for Mademoiselle
5,null,null,a color that vied with the June roses charged through her cheeks
6,null,null,She stooped to pick up her sewing
7,null,null,but Nick was before her .
206 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,No
2,null,null,'' I answered shortly
3,null,null,Then I realized suddenly what I had failed to grasp before
4,fear,feared,she feared that I would pity her .
207 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,For a while the tune held its mad pace
2,null,null,and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note
3,null,null,for Zeron had broken a string
4,null,null,Amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room I saw Nick stop before an open window in which a prying Indian was framed
5,null,null,swing Suzanne at arm 's length
6,fear,startled him into life,and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life .
208 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,We lighted a candle
2,null,null,and poking around
3,null,null,found the negro where he had crept into the farthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall
4,fear,blood curdling,And when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was blood curdling .
209 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The young lady did nothing of the kind
2,null,null,She turned her back to us
3,null,null,leaned against the tree
4,surprise,to my astonishment,and to my astonishment I saw her slim shoulders shaken with laughter
5,null,null,At length
6,null,null,very slowly
7,null,null,she looked around
8,null,null,and in her face struggled curiosity and fear and merriment .
211 7
 (5, 1),
1,null,null,Presently the sobs ceased
2,null,null,and Mrs
3,null,null,Temple raised her face
4,null,null,slowly
5,surprise,wondering ly,wondering ly
6,null,null,as if she had not heard aright
7,null,null,And she tried gently to push the girl away .
212 11
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,Liberty
2,null,null,Equality
3,null,null,Fraternity
4,null,null,they are only possible for the bachelor
5,null,null,Hearing a noise
6,fear,nervously,he glanced nervously in the direction of the woods
7,null,null,only to perceive his negro carrying a pail of water
8,null,null,I I was expecting some friends
9,null,null,'' he said
10,null,null,Sit down
11,null,null,Davy
213 14
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,And wasnt it me that said he could smell the devils
2,null,null,'' said Terence
3,null,null,as he circled around us in a mimic war dance
4,surprise,in astonishment,And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment
5,null,null,and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing
6,null,null,For the back woodsmen were children of nature
7,null,null,Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain
8,null,null,and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played   Billy of the Wild Woods and   Jump Juba
9,null,null,'' with all his might
10,null,null,and the pine knots threw their fitful
11,null,null,red light on the wild scenes of merriment
12,null,null,I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance
13,null,null,for presently Colonel Clark came up to us
14,null,null,laughing in his quiet way .
214 14
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,And wasnt it me that said he could smell the devils
2,null,null,'' said Terence
3,null,null,as he circled around us in a mimic war dance
4,null,null,And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment
5,happiness,the wildest rejoicing,and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing
6,null,null,For the back woodsmen were children of nature
7,null,null,Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain

12,null,null,I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance
13,null,null,for presently Colonel Clark came up to us
14,null,null,laughing in his quiet way .
215 15
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Then came the sugaring
2,null,null,the warm days and the freezing nights when the earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red sunset
3,null,null,Old and young went to the camps
4,null,null,the women and children boiling and graining
5,null,null,the squads of men posted in guards round about
6,null,null,And after that the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst suddenly into white flower
7,null,null,and it was spring again
8,happiness,joy,And then a joy to be long remembered  I went on a hunting trip with Tom and Cowan and three others where the Kentucky tumbles between its darkly wooded cliffs
9,null,null,And other wonders of that strange land I saw then for the first time :  great licks
10,null,null,trampled down for acres by the wild herds
11,null,null,where the salt water oozes out of the hoofprints
12,null,null,On the edge of one of these licks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here and there in the black mud
13,null,null,and great skulls of fearful beasts half embedded
14,null,null,This was called the Big Bone Lick
15,null,null,and some travellers that went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these monsters of a past age .
216 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Then I heard a voice calling me
2,null,null,and pushing past Mrs
3,null,null,Cowan
4,null,null,I ran into the cabin
5,null,null,Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead
6,surprise,not imagined,and she turned to mine a face radiant with a happiness I had not imagined
217 15
 (13, 13),
1,null,null,The Indians had shot at a party shelling corn at Captain Bowman 's plantation
2,null,null,and killed two
3,null,null,while the others had taken refuge in the crib
4,null,null,Fired at from every brake
5,null,null,James Ray had ridden to Harrodstown for succor
6,null,null,and the savages had been beaten off
7,null,null,But only the foolhardy returned to their clearings now
8,null,null,We were on the edge of another dreaded summer of siege
9,null,null,the prospect of banishment from the homes we could almost see
10,null,null,staring us in the face
11,null,null,and the labors of the spring lost again
12,null,null,There was bitter talk within the gates that night
13,anger,angrily,and many declared angrily that Colonel Clark had abandoned us
14,null,null,But I remembered what he had said
15,null,null,and had faith in him .
218 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,They turned
2,happiness,an ecstasy of joy,and in an ecstasy of joy quite pitiful to see went trooping out of the gate
3,null,null,But scarce could they have reached the street and we have broken ranks
4,null,null,when we saw them coming back again
5,null,null,the priest leading them as before
6,null,null,They drew near to the spot where Clark stood
7,null,null,talking to the captains
8,null,null,and halted expectantly .
219 3
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,The group stood wistful
2,fear,fearful,fearful that their boldness had displeased
3,null,null,expectant of reprimand .
220 6
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,At length the cocks crowing for day proclaimed the morning
2,null,null,and while yet the blue shadow of the bluff was on the town
3,null,null,Colonel Clark sallied out of the gate and walked abroad
4,surprise,Strange,Strange it seemed that war had come to this village
5,null,null,so peaceful and remote
6,null,null,And even stranger it seemed to me to see these Arcadian homes in the midst of the fierce wilderness .
221 17
 (10, 11),(10, 12),
1,null,null,Excitement keyed us high
2,null,null,we reached the shade
3,null,null,plunged into it
4,null,null,and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing
5,null,null,It had once defended the place
6,null,null,but now stood abandoned and dismantled
7,null,null,Beyond it
8,null,null,at the edge of the bluff
9,null,null,we halted
10,surprise,astonished,astonished
11,null,null,The sun was falling in the west
12,null,null,and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much
13,null,null,At our feet
14,null,null,across the wooded bottom
15,null,null,was the Kaskaskia River
16,null,null,and beyond
17,null,null,the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light .
222 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,To see the strange places of the world
2,null,null,and the stranger people
3,null,null,to become a man of wealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo
4,fear,fear,and ( I fear I loved it best ) to match my brains with others at a bargain
5,null,null,I turned it all over slowly
6,null,null,gravely
7,null,null,in my boyish mind
8,null,null,rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin .
226 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,saving ' your Honor 's presence
2,null,null,'' said Terence
3,fear,afraid,he 's afraid your Honor will be sending him on the boat
4,null,null,Sure
5,null,null,he wants to go swimming ' with the rest of us
227 8
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,The kettles  long disused were fetched
2,null,null,and broth made and fed in sips to the weakest
3,null,null,while the strongest looked on and smiled in an agony of self-restraint
4,fear,a fearful thing,It was a fearful thing to see men whose legs had refused service struggle to their feet when they had drunk the steaming
5,null,null,greasy mixture
6,null,null,And the Colonel
7,null,null,standing by the river 's edge
8,null,null,turned his face away down stream .
228 8
 (4, 5),(5, 5),
1,null,null,He told us that a man named Maisonville
2,null,null,with a party of Indians
3,null,null,was in pursuit of him
4,sadness,raising our despair,and the next piece of news he had was in the way of raising our despair a little
5,sadness,astonishment,Governor Hamilton 's astonishment at seeing this force here and now would be as great as his own
6,null,null,Governor Hamilton had said
7,null,null,indeed
8,null,null,that only a navy could take Vincennes this year .
229 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Davy
2,null,null,'' he whispered
3,null,null,and I pinched him
4,null,null,Davy
5,surprise,surprised,I reckon Polly Ann'd be kinder surprised if she knew where we was
6,null,null,Eh
230 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There was no time to think
2,fear,fear,my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann
3,null,null,Just then I heard her calling out to me .
231 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I flushed again
2,null,null,and began by stammering
3,fear,fear,For I had a great fear that Major Colfax 's temper would fly into bits when he heard it .
232 9
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Presently my father looked up from his book
2,null,null,but did not rise
3,null,null,As for me
4,surprise,astonishment,I had been staring for some time in astonishment
5,null,null,for he was a better looking man than I had ever seen
6,null,null,He wore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black
7,null,null,but
8,null,null,in place of a coonskin cap with the tail hanging down
9,null,null,a hat .
233 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,I recall a fear that my father would not fancy him
2,null,null,In such cases he would give a stranger food
3,null,null,and leave him to himself .
234 4
 (1, 1),(1, 2),(1, 3),
1,fear,surprised,One day I was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our cabin
2,null,null,crying out for my father
3,null,null,for he was a violent man
4,null,null,And a violent scene followed .
235 12
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then the moment of departure came
2,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite acknowledged the parting remarks of the servants
3,happiness,secretly delighted,who were secretly delighted to be freed from her presence
4,null,null,and then
5,null,null,before entering the carriage
6,null,null,she cast a long
7,null,null,sad look upon this princely mansion which she had once had the right to believe her own
8,null,null,but which she was
9,null,null,alas
10,null,null,now leaving
11,null,null,in all probability
12,null,null,for ever .
236 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The worthy housekeeper was present at this conference
2,fear,feared,For an instant she had feared that Mademoiselle Marguerite suspected her manoeuvres but her fears were now dispelled
3,null,null,and she even congratulated herself on her skilful ness .
237 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This furnished Madame de Fondege with another excuse for proffering her advice
2,null,null,But Mademoiselle Marguerite would not allow herself to be convinced at once
3,null,null,She raised a great many objections
4,happiness,happy,and parleyed for a long time before telling Madame de Fondege that she would be happy to accept the hospitality which had been offered her
5,null,null,And her consent was by no means unconditional .
238 10
 (3, 9),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's address must be there
2,null,null,so she asked and obtained permission to examine this notebook
3,happiness,to her great joy,and to her great joy
4,null,null,under the letter  "  F
5,null,null,"   she found the entry :   "  Fortunat ( Isidore )
6,null,null,No
7,null,null,28 Place de la Bourse
8,null,null,"  Ah
9,null,null,im sure that I shall find Pascal now
10,null,null,"   she exclaimed .
239 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,On the previous evening he had said to her :   "  Farewell until to-morrow
2,null,null,"   and knowing that his work in the house had not been concluded
3,surprise,extremely surprised,she was extremely surprised that he had not yet put in an appearance .
241 2
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,despairing gesture,Marguerite 's only reply was a despairing gesture
2,null,null,It would have been impossible for her to articulate a syllable her tears were choking her .
242 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Arrayed in his best uniform
2,null,null,his thin legs encased in black silk stockings
3,null,null,his mantle thrown gracefully over his shoulders
4,null,null,and his cocked hat under his arm
5,fear,anxiously,he was looking anxiously about for some one in the assembled crowd to whom he could give the signal for departure
6,null,null,He was already talking of starting off when M
7,null,null,de Fondege appeared .
244 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,But how she revenged herself
2,null,null,She was  "  virtuous
3,null,null,"   but so dangerously virtuous that one might have supposed she was so against her will
4,sadness,bitterly  regretted,and that she bitterly  regretted it
5,null,null,She ruled her husband with a rod of iron .
245 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I searched under all the trees
2,null,null,and yet I could not find her
3,null,null,It was as dark as pitch
4,fear,a terrible fear,and suddenly a terrible fear seized hold of me such a terrible fright that I really believe I called for help
5,null,null,and I ran back to the house half crazed .  "
246 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But the worthy woman had already recovered her self possession and her accustomed loquacity at the same time
2,null,null,"  Ah
3,null,null,my dear young lady
4,null,null,"   she said
5,null,null,bravely
6,sadness,in such sorrow,"  im in such sorrow that im losing my senses completely
7,null,null,Still
8,null,null,it was only from the kindest of motives that I ventured into the garden
9,null,null,and I had scarcely entered it before I saw something white run away from me I felt sure it was Mirza and so I ran after it .
247 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday
2,null,null,Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country
3,fear,feared,and Chupin feared he might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements
4,null,null,And while running to the Place de la Bourse
5,null,null,he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate
6,null,null,deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says :   "  It is not always well to tell the whole truth .  "
248 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Still it did not prevent him from trying to justify himself
2,null,null,although he was careful not to confess the truth
3,fear,dreaded,for he dreaded his mother 's censure
4,null,null,knowing well enough that she would be less indulgent than his own conscience .
249 16
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,However
2,null,null,the effect of this discovery was to dispel his anger
3,null,null,or rather to restore his calmness
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,addressing M
6,null,null,de Coralth
7,null,null,he exclaimed :   "  dont be angry at what i 've said
8,null,null,m ' sieur
9,null,null,it was only a jest I know that there 's a wide difference between a poor devil like me and a viscount like you I have n't a sou
10,null,null,you see
11,anger,maddens,and that maddens me
12,null,null,But im not so very bad looking
13,null,null,fortunately
14,null,null,and im always hoping that the daughter of some rich banker will fall in love with me and marry me
15,null,null,Some people have such luck
16,null,null,you know .
251 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,He had made a hundred turns perhaps
2,null,null,passing the events of the day in review
3,null,null,when suddenly such a strange and startling idea flashed across his mind that he stood motionless
4,surprise,lost in astonishment,lost in astonishment
5,null,null,Reflecting on the manner in which M
6,null,null,Wilkie and the Viscount de Coralth had behaved during the evening
7,null,null,a singular suspicion assailed him .
252 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,But he racked his brain in vain in trying to remember who this newcomer was
2,null,null,in trying to set a name on this face
3,null,null,which was positively annoying in its classical beauty
4,null,null,and which he felt convinced had occupied a place among the phantoms of his past
5,anger,Irritated beyond endurance,Irritated beyond endurance by what he termed his stupidity
6,null,null,he was trying to decide whether he should enter the cafe or not
7,null,null,when he saw M
8,null,null,Wilkie take his bill from the hands of a waiter
9,null,null,glance at it
10,null,null,and throw a louis on the table .
253 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,"  You shall pay for this
2,null,null,you little wretch
3,anger,so indignant,"   He was so indignant that the gamin element in his nature stirred again under his fine broadcloth
4,null,null,and he had a wild longing to throw stones at M
5,null,null,Wilkie .
254 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,He was carrying a letter which he wished to have delivered
2,fear,feared,and no doubt he feared he would not be able to find a commissionaire
3,null,null,Having discovered one at last
4,null,null,he called him
5,null,null,gave him the missive
6,null,null,and then pursued his way more leisurely .
255 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Having come with the intention of offering his agent a handsome sum
2,surprise,surprised,he was agreeably surprised to find that Chupin 's scruples would enable him to save his money
3,null,null,"  If I had not found you engaged in study
4,null,null,Victor
5,null,null,"   he said
6,null,null,"  I should have thought you had been drinking .
257 9
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,Fortunat was amazed
2,null,null,and at the same time much annoyed
3,null,null,to find himself forsaken on account of such a trifle
4,fear,feared,He feared
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,that Chupin might let his tongue wag if he left his employment
7,null,null,So
8,null,null,since he had confided this project to Chupin
9,null,null,he was determined that Chupin alone should carry it into execution .
258 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,If any one heard them
2,null,null,no one came
3,null,null,still they recalled Pascal to a sense of the situation
4,sadness,ashamed,and he was ashamed of his violence
5,null,null,He released Madame Leon
6,null,null,and his manner suddenly became as humble as it had been threatening .
259 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The frightened housekeeper struggled with all her might
2,null,null,trying her best to reach the little gate which was standing open
3,null,null,"  You hurt me
4,sadness,she cried,"   she cried
5,null,null,"  Are you mad
260 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Madame Ferailleur understood this feeling
2,null,null,but she was a mother
3,null,null,and as such
4,disgust,jealous,jealous of her son 's tenderness
5,null,null,and anxious for particulars concerning this rival who had suddenly usurped her place in the heart where she had long reigned supreme .
261 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,She was oppressed by vague apprehensions
2,null,null,and looked closely at every one who passed her
3,fear,fearing,fearing the presence of spies
4,null,null,and knowing full well that the most profound secrecy could alone insure the success of Pascal 's plans .
262 15
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,she was flying secretly
3,null,null,and alone
4,null,null,under an assumed name
5,null,null,trembling at the thought of pursuit or recognition flying as a criminal flies at thought of his crime
6,fear,fear,and fear of punishment
7,null,null,She had far less suffered on the day
8,null,null,when
9,null,null,with her son upon her knees
10,null,null,she journeyed to the cemetery
11,null,null,following all that was mortal of the man who had been her only thought
12,null,null,her love
13,null,null,her pride
14,null,null,her happiness
15,null,null,and hope .
264 4
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Overcome by a flood of recollections
2,happiness,tears sprang to his eyes,the tears sprang to his eyes
3,null,null,He embraced his mother
4,null,null,and fled precipitately from the house .

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  Crazy in the fullest sense of the word
2,fear,fear,She refuses the count 's millions from a silly fear of telling people that she belongs to the Chalusse family
3,null,null,She threatened her brother
4,null,null,but she would never have carried her threats into execution .
267 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,There was but one certain and positive thing
2,null,null,and this was that the money he had counted upon had escaped him
3,null,null,and he experienced as acute a pang as if he had lost forty thousand francs a second time
4,null,null,Perhaps
5,null,null,at that moment
6,sadness,sorry,he was sorry that he had severed his connection with the marquis .
268 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I shall expect you from three o'clock to six
2,null,null,Come
3,null,null,I implore you
4,null,null,come
5,sadness,painful,It is painful to me to add that if I do not hear from you
6,null,null,I am resolved to demand and OBTAIN no matter what may be the consequences the means which I have
7,null,null,so far
8,null,null,asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands
269 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,The sun was just flooding the slopes when our guest arose to leave
2,null,null,and my father bade him god speed with a heartiness that was rare to him
3,null,null,But
4,sadness,bitter regret,to my bitter regret
5,null,null,neither spoke of my father 's going
6,null,null,Being a man of understanding
7,null,null,Mr
8,null,null,Boone knew it were little use to press .
270 3
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,And he wore a waistcoat all sewed with flowers
2,null,null,With a boy 's intuition
3,disgust,dislike,I began to dislike him intensely .
271 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,As I have said
2,null,null,he was a wild lad
3,null,null,sobered by none of the things which had gone to make my life
4,null,null,and what he took into his head to do he generally did
5,null,null,or
6,null,null,if balked
7,anger,rage,flew into such a rage as to make one believe he could not live
8,null,null,Life was always war with him
9,null,null,or some semblance of a struggle .
272 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She shot at him a withering look
2,fear,fear,for even in her fear she would brook no liberties
3,null,null,Nick spoke up :

4,null,null,what are you doing here with that big Congo for a dog
5,fear,frightens,The sight of him frightens me
275 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,It was a long
2,null,null,long time before Nick 's breathing told me that he was asleep
3,null,null,He held me tightly clutched to him
4,fear,feared,and I know that he feared I would leave him
5,null,null,The thought of going broke my heart
6,null,null,but I never once wavered in my resolve
7,null,null,and I lay staring into the darkness
8,null,null,pondering what to do .
276 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,When
2,null,null,from time to time
3,null,null,the snow melted on the hillsides
4,surprise,surprised,I sometimes surprised a deer there and shot him with the heavy rifle
5,null,null,And so the months wore on till spring .
277 6
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,She never took me with her on these journeys
2,sadness,eyes would be red,but nearly always when she came back at nightfall her eyes would be red
3,null,null,and I knew the two women had been weeping together
4,null,null,There came a certain hot Sunday in July when she went on this errand
5,null,null,and Grandpa Ripley having gone to spend the day at old man Winn 's
6,null,null,I was left alone .
278 3
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,At that he bent back his head and laughed
2,anger,anger,which made me redden with anger
3,null,null,Then he turned and looked at me more soberly .
279 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,She raised one objection after another
2,null,null,but Tom was a firm man
3,disgust,impatient,and his late experiences in the wilderness had made him impatient of trifling
4,null,null,He had promised the Kentucky settlers
5,null,null,fighting for their lives in their blockhouses
6,null,null,that he would come back again .
280 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,It was no hardship to a lad brought up in woodcraft
2,fear,Fear,Fear of the Indians
3,null,null,like a dog shivering with the cold
4,null,null,was a deadened pain on the border .
281 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Do you think he 's at home
2,null,null,Tom
3,null,null,'' I asked
4,fear,fearful,fearful that I should not see this celebrated person .
282 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Imploring her not to go
2,null,null,he became wild again
3,sadness,brought tears to her eyes,and brought tears to her eyes when he spoke of his own wife
4,null,null,They tomahawked her
5,null,null,ma ' am
6,null,null,because she could not walk
7,null,null,and the baby beside her
8,null,null,and I standing by with my arms tied
283 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The agony was the breathing space we had while they crept nearer
2,null,null,Then we thought of Tom
3,fear,fear,and I dared not glance at Polly Ann for fear that the sight of her face would unnerve me .
284 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,They had once seemed to me an unexplored and forbidden country as I searched them with my eyes from the sentry boxes
2,disgust,shame,And yet I felt a shame to go with Polly Ann and Mrs
3,null,null,Cowan and the women while James Ray and Tom sat with the guard of men between us and the forest line .

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,By Job
2,fear,fears,there 's no devil if i 'll stand back from my clearing and waste the rest of the summer for the fears of a pack of cowards
3,null,null,i 'll take a posse and march to Shawanee Springs this day
4,null,null,and see any man a fair fight that tries to stop me

1,null,null,"  does n't he do it well
2,null,null,"   said the girl
3,happiness,with admiring eyes,following  with admiring eyes every movement of his well poised frame .

 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  Well
2,null,null,come on then
3,null,null,You must come
4,sadness,disappointed,they 'll all be disappointed
5,null,null,if you dont

7,null,null,too .
288 4
 (4, 1),
1,null,null,"  But they will not taste a bit like yours
2,null,null,im sure

5,sadness,pity,He remembered his surprise and pity
6,null,null,almost contempt
7,null,null,for big Tom Magee lying on the floor unable to lift his head
8,null,null,remembered
9,null,null,too
10,null,null,the strange absence of anything like elation at the doctor 's words
11,null,null,"  My boy
12,null,null,you have the nerve and the fingers of a surgeon
13,null,null,and that 's what your Maker intended you to be .  "
291 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,And wasnt it me that said he could smell the devils
2,null,null,'' said Terence
3,null,null,as he circled around us in a mimic war dance
4,surprise,in astonishment,And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment
5,null,null,and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing .
292 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But so modest was he that he would not let it be known that he was in the station

381 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,He was still sitting with his elbow upon his knee
2,null,null,considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter

385 6
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,puzzled,How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely
2,null,null,for his servants slept in an outhouse
3,null,null,and the doors and windows had all been secured
4,null,null,He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter
5,null,null,but the incident struck a chill into his heart
6,null,null,The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised .

 (3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,Still more shaken was he next morning
2,null,null,They had sat down to their breakfast

4,null,null,In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled
5,null,null,with a burned stick apparently
6,null,null,the number 28
7,null,null,To his daughter it was unintelligible
8,null,null,and he did not enlighten her
9,null,null,That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward .
387 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success
2,null,null,though
3,null,null,from the marks upon the bark of the trees
4,null,null,and other indications
5,null,null,he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity
6,null,null,At last
7,null,null,after two or three hours   fruitless search
8,sadness,despair,he was thinking of turning back in despair
9,null,null,when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart
10,null,null,On the edge of a jutting pinnacle
11,null,null,three or four hundred feet above him
12,null,null,there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance
13,null,null,but armed with a pair of gigantic horns .
389 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Their faces were pale and sad
2,null,null,and there were tears in the eyes of some of them
3,null,null,What was passing in their minds
4,fear,fear,Perhaps they were overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected death always provokes
5,null,null,Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master
6,null,null,whose bread they ate
7,null,null,Perhaps their grief was only selfishness
8,null,null,and they were merely wondering what would become of them
9,null,null,where they should find another situation
10,null,null,and if it would prove a good one .
390 11
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,No one ventured to reply
2,surprise,surprise,and in her surprise she cast a hasty glance around
3,null,null,From where she stood
4,null,null,she could not see the bed stationed in an alcove
5,null,null,but she instantly noted the dejected attitude of the servants
6,null,null,the clothing scattered about the floor
7,null,null,and the disorder that pervaded this magnificent but severely furnished chamber
8,null,null,which was only lighted by the lamp which M
9,null,null,Bourigeau
10,null,null,the concierge
11,null,null,carried .

1,null,null,"  Something occurred this very morning
2,disgust,annoy,which seemed to annoy him very much .  "
395 10
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,At five he rose
2,null,null,kissed me gay ly
3,null,null,and left the house on foot
4,null,null,telling me that he was confident of success
5,null,null,and that he did not expect to return before midnight
6,null,null,The poor child 's firmness now gave way
7,sadness,eyes filled with tears,her eyes filled with tears
8,null,null,and it was in a voice choked with sobs that she added
9,null,null,pointing to M
10,null,null,de Chalusse :    "  But at half-past six they brought him back as you see him now   "
397 3
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,pleasing,Such a proposal was anything but pleasing to M
2,null,null,Jodon
3,null,null,who had met with the same misfortune in this aristocratic neighborhood several times before .
398 7
 (6, 4),(6, 5),
1,null,null,When an accident happened
2,null,null,he was summoned because he chanced to be close at hand
3,null,null,but just as he was flattering himself that he had gained a desirable patient
4,null,null,he found himself in presence of some celebrated physician
5,null,null,who had come from a distance in his carriage
6,sadness,disappointments,Accustomed to such disappointments
7,null,null,he knew how to conceal his dissatisfaction .
399 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,As a rule
2,null,null,Chupin was not easily impressed
3,fear,frightened,but he felt almost frightened by his employer 's agitation
4,null,null,"  I only repeated what M
5,null,null,Casimir told me
6,null,null,monsieur
7,null,null,"   was his reply .
400 8
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,"  I can certainly discover the necessary pretext here
2,null,null,"   he murmured
3,null,null,rummaging through the mass of papers
4,null,null,But he did not at once find what he sought
5,disgust,impatient,and he was growing impatient
6,null,null,as could be seen by his feverish haste
7,null,null,when all at once he paused with a sigh of relief
8,null,null,"  At last
401 12
 (7, 4),(7, 6),
1,null,null,The woman looked at him
2,null,null,Most job masters are in the habit of giving five sous to any servant who comes in search of a cab for his master
3,null,null,and this was the custom here
4,null,null,But the keeper of the office
5,null,null,who felt sure that Chupin was not a servant
6,null,null,hesitated
7,anger,angry,and this made the young fellow angry
8,null,null,"  Make haste
9,null,null,"   he cried
10,null,null,imperiously
11,null,null,"  If you dont
12,null,null,I shall run to the nearest stand .  "
402 9
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,But to carry out this arrangement it was necessary to have a sheet of stamped paper
2,null,null,and the spurious clerk had neglected to provide himself with some
3,disgust,annoy,This circumstance seemed to annoy him greatly
4,null,null,and you might almost have sworn that he regretted the concession he had promised
5,null,null,Did he think of going
6,null,null,Madame Vantrasson feared so
7,null,null,and turning eagerly to her husband
8,null,null,she exclaimed :    "  Run to the tobacco shop in the Rue de Levis
9,null,null,you will find some paper there
404 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Isidore Fortunat was literally upon the rack
2,null,null,and to make his sufferings still more horrible
3,null,null,he dared not ask any direct question
4,null,null,nor allow his curiosity to become manifest
5,fear,fear,for fear of alarming the woman
6,null,null,"  Let me see
7,null,null,"   said he
8,null,null,"  I think I am sure that I have heard or that I have read I cannot say which some story about a Mademoiselle de Chalusse
9,null,null,It was something terrible
10,null,null,wasnt it
405 11
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,It was Madame Vantrasson 's turn to tremble now
2,fear,feared,She feared
3,null,null,if she allowed this supposed clerk to go without signing the agreement
4,null,null,that the person who came in his stead might not prove so accommodating
5,null,null,and even if he called again himself
6,null,null,he might not be so kindly disposed
7,null,null,"  Wait just a moment longer
8,null,null,monsieur
9,null,null,"   she pleaded
10,null,null,"  my husband will soon be back
11,null,null,and the last omnibus does n't leave the Rue de Levis until midnight .  "
406 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,At this point in her narrative Madame Vantrasson evinced a desire to pause and draw a breath
2,null,null,and perhaps partake of some slight refreshment
3,null,null,but M
4,disgust,impatient,Fortunat was impatient
5,null,null,The woman 's husband might return at any moment
6,null,null,"  And
7,null,null,after that
8,null,null,"   he inquired .
408 16
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,You could not say that M
2,null,null,Fortunat was angry
3,null,null,Such a man
4,null,null,as cold and as smooth as a hundred franc piece
5,null,null,has no useless passions
6,null,null,But he was intensely irritated to hear his client foolishly chanting the paeons of victory
7,null,null,while he was compelled to conceal his grief at the loss of his forty thousand francs
8,null,null,deep in the recesses of his heart
9,null,null,So
10,null,null,far from being touched by the marquis 's evident alarm
11,happiness,pleased,it pleased him to be able to turn the dagger in the wound he had just inflicted
12,null,null,"  You must excuse my incredulity
13,null,null,"   said he
14,null,null,"  It comes entirely from something you
15,null,null,yourself
16,null,null,told me about a week ago .  "

1,null,null,de Valorsay paced the floor in a state of intense agitation
2,null,null,Had he caught a glimpse of his own face in the looking-glass
3,fear,frightened,it would have frightened him

11,null,null,what do you understand by a gentleman

410 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Fortunat would certainly have preferred to lose a good pound of flesh rather than the sum of money mentioned
2,null,null,but
3,null,null,on the other hand
4,null,null,he felt that it would not do for him to sever his connection with his client until the death of the Count de Chalusse was certain

412 8
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's embarrassment was really painful to witness
2,null,null,He was not usually wanting in courage
3,null,null,but the events of the evening had shaken his confidence and his composure
4,null,null,The hope of gain and the fear of loss had deprived him of his wanted clearness of mind
5,null,null,Feeling that he had just committed a terrible blunder
6,null,null,he racked his brain to find some way of repairing it
7,null,null,and finding none
8,sadness,confusion,his confusion increased .

5,null,null,thought the banker 's conduct perfectly natural and just
6,null,null,It is true that Madame d' argeles was in despair during forty-eight hours or so

9,null,null,Not at all
10,null,null,however
11,null,null,on the contrary
12,null,null,she had good cause to congratulate herself upon the notoriety she gained through this suicide
13,null,null,For five days she was the talk of Paris
14,null,null,and Alfred d' aunay even published her portrait in the Illustrated Chronicle .

12,null,null,Not at all
13,null,null,however
416 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A score of persons were seated at the card table
2,null,null,and the guests who had retired into the adjoining salon were silently watching the progress of the game
3,null,null,or quietly chatting in the corners of the room
4,surprise,surprised,It surprised him to note that every one spoke in very low tones
5,null,null,there was something very like respect
6,null,null,even awe
7,null,null,in this subdued murmur
8,null,null,One might have supposed that those present were celebrating the rites of some mysterious worship .
418 13
 (7, 5),
1,null,null,However the game proceeded
2,null,null,but no one paid any attention to it
3,null,null,The stakes were insignificant
4,null,null,and loss or gain drew no exclamation from any one
5,null,null,The attention of the entire party was concentrated on Pascal
6,null,null,and he
7,sadness,with despair in his heart,with despair in his heart
8,null,null,followed the movements of the cards
9,null,null,which were passing from hand to hand
10,null,null,and fast approaching him again
11,null,null,When they reached him the silence became breathless
12,null,null,menacing
13,null,null,even sinister .
419 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He did not deign to turn his head
2,null,null,What did the insult matter to him
3,null,null,He knew himself to be innocent
4,sadness,disgraced,and yet he felt that he was sinking to the lowest depths of infamy he beheld himself disgraced
5,null,null,branded
6,null,null,ruined
7,null,null,And realizing that he must meet facts with facts
8,null,null,he besought God to grant him an idea
9,null,null,an inspiration
10,null,null,that would unmask the real culprit .

 (2, 5),
1,null,null,Such was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests
2,anger,angry,Four or five of the ladies took flight at the bare suggestion and several men the most aristocratic of the company became angry at once
3,null,null,"  Are you mad
4,null,null,"   said one of them
5,null,null,"  Do you want to see us all summoned as witnesses
6,null,null,You have probably forgotten that Garcia affair
7,null,null,and that rumpus at Jenny Fancy 's house
8,null,null,A fine thing it would be to see
9,null,null,no one knows how many great names mixed up with those of sharper s and notorious women
422 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,This superb outburst of outraged honor
2,null,null,this marvellous energy  succeeding
3,null,null,as it did
4,null,null,the most complete mental prostration and these terrible threats
5,null,null,had proved so prompt and awe-inspiring that no one had thought of cutting off Pascal 's retreat
6,null,null,The guests had not recovered from their stupor
7,fear,silent and intimidated,but were still standing silent and intimidated when they heard the outer door close after him .

1,null,null,It shuts its eyes and refuses to look or listen
2,null,null,But this is all the more reason why it should be pitiless when a person 's guilt is positively established
3,null,null,Thus
4,null,null,although he assumed an air of insolent security
5,fear,anxiously,the  "  viscount "   anxiously watched the effect of his words upon Madame d' argeles
6,null,null,Fortunately for himself
7,null,null,he saw that she was abashed by his cynicism
8,null,null,and so he resumed :   "  Besides
9,null,null,as our friend

11,null,null,would say
12,null,null,we are wasting precious time in discussing improbable

424 15
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,disgust,impatient,With the impatient gesture of a man who finds himself compelled to answer an idle question
2,null,null,and assuming an air of hypocritical commiseration
3,null,null,he replied :   "  Well
4,null,null,since you insist upon it
5,null,null,I know
6,null,null,in Paris in the Rue de Helder

9,null,null,He has wanted for nothing since the day he came into the world
10,null,null,At school
11,null,null,he had three times as much money as his richest play fellow
12,null,null,When his studies were finished
13,null,null,a tutor was provided with his pockets full of gold to conduct this favored youth to Italy

12,null,null,There
13,null,null,my dear lady
14,null,null,your letter ended
15,null,null,but the name and address were given
16,null,null,and it was easy enough to understand it
17,null,null,You remember
18,null,null,perhaps
19,null,null,a little incident that occurred after your return .
428 10
 (5, 5),(5, 7),(5, 10),
1,null,null,She went to sleep one night possessing an income of fifteen thousand francs
2,null,null,but she awoke to find herself ruined so completely ruined that she did not know where to obtain her dinner for that same evening
3,null,null,Had she been alone in the world
4,null,null,she would not have grieved much over the catastrophe
5,sadness,sadly,but she was sadly affected by the thought that her son 's future was
6,null,null,perhaps
7,null,null,irrevocably blighted
8,null,null,and that
9,null,null,in any case
10,null,null,this disaster would condemn him to enter life through the cramped and gloomy portals of poverty .
429 8
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,She almost fainted
2,null,null,after bearing adversity so bravely
3,null,null,this happiness proved too much for her
4,surprise,could scarcely believe it,She could scarcely believe it
5,null,null,A long explanation was necessary to convince her of the truth
6,null,null,and then big tears
7,null,null,tears of joy this time
8,null,null,gushed from her eyes .

433 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,What should she do
2,null,null,Her first impulse was to run to the Commissary of Police 's office or to the house of Pascal 's friend
3,null,null,but on the other hand
4,null,null,she dared not go out
5,fear,fear,for fear he might return in her absence
6,null,null,Thus
7,null,null,in an agony of suspense
8,null,null,she waited counting the seconds by the quick throbbing s of her temples
9,null,null,and straining her ears to catch the slightest sound .
434 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,He had barely strength enough to throw himself on to the bed
2,null,null,and in a moment he was sleeping with that heavy slumber which so often seizes hold of one on the occasion of a great crisis
3,null,null,and which has so frequently been observed among persons condemned to death
4,null,null,on the night preceding their execution
5,null,null,Four or five times his mother came to listen at the door
6,null,null,Once she entered
7,null,null,and seeing her son sleeping soundly
8,happiness,a smile of satisfaction,she could not repress a smile of satisfaction
9,null,null,"  Poor Pascal
10,null,null,"   she thought
11,null,null,"  he can bear no excess but excess of work
12,null,null,Heavens
13,null,null,how surprised and mortified he will be when he awakes

436 13
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,Contrary to his usual custom
2,null,null,he took the little staircase on the right
3,null,null,leading to the grand vestibule
4,null,null,where several lawyers were assembled
5,null,null,earnestly engaged in conversation
6,null,null,They were evidently astonished to see Pascal
7,null,null,and their conversation abruptly ceased on his approach
8,null,null,They assumed a grave look and turned away their heads in disgust
9,null,null,The unfortunate man at once realized the truth
10,null,null,and pressed his hand to his forehead
11,sadness,despairing,with a despairing gesture
12,null,null,as he murmured :   "  Already
13,null,null,already
437 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Pascal read as follows :   "  There was great sensation and a terrible scandal last night at the residence of Madame d' a
2,null,null,a well-known star of the first magnitude
3,happiness,enjoying,A score of gentlemen of high rank and immense wealth were enjoying a quiet game of baccarat
4,null,null,when it was observed that M
5,null,null,F   was winning in a most extraordinary manner
6,null,null,He was watched and detected in the very act of dexterously slipping some cards into the pack he held .
439 8
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,He little fancied at that supreme moment that each of his gestures
2,null,null,each contraction of his features
3,null,null,were viewed by the mother whose name he faltered
4,null,null,Since her son had left her to go to the Palais de Justice
5,fear,crazy with anxiety,the poor woman had remained almost crazy with anxiety
6,null,null,and when she heard him return and lock himself in his office a thing he had never done before a fearful presentiment was aroused in her mind
7,null,null,Gliding into her son 's bedroom
8,null,null,she at once approached the door communicating with his office .
440 22
 (13, 10),(13, 11),
1,null,null,The upper part of this portal was of glass
2,null,null,it was possible to see what was occurring in the adjoining room
3,null,null,When Madame Ferailleur perceived Pascal seat himself at his desk and begin to write
4,null,null,she felt a trifle reassured
5,null,null,and almost thought of going away
6,null,null,But a vague dread
7,null,null,stronger than reason or will
8,null,null,riveted her to the spot
9,null,null,A few moments later
10,null,null,when she saw the revolver in her son 's hand
11,null,null,she understood everything
12,null,null,Her blood froze in her veins
13,fear,terror,and yet she had sufficient self-control to repress the cry of terror which sprang to her lips
14,null,null,She realized that the danger was terrible
15,null,null,imminent
16,null,null,extreme
17,null,null,Her heart
18,null,null,rather than her bewildered reason
19,null,null,told her that her son 's life hung on a single thread
20,null,null,The slightest sound
21,null,null,a word
22,null,null,a rap on the door might hasten the unfortunate man 's deed .
441 10
 (1, 4),
1,sadness,despondently,He lowered his head despondently
2,null,null,and in a tone of profound discouragement
3,null,null,he replied :   "  But what can I do
4,null,null,How can I escape from the web which has been woven around me with such fiendish cunning
5,null,null,If I had possessed my usual presence of mind at the moment of the accusation
6,null,null,I might have defended and justified myself
7,null,null,perhaps
8,null,null,But now the misfortune is irreparable
9,null,null,How can I unmask the traitor
10,null,null,and what proofs of his guilt can I cast in his face
442 20
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,Pascal was absorbed in thought
2,null,null,"  And what a strange coincidence
3,null,null,"   he eventually remarked
4,null,null,"  Do you know
5,null,null,the last time I saw Marguerite
6,null,null,a week ago
7,null,null,she seemed so sad and anxious that I felt alarmed
8,null,null,I questioned her
9,null,null,but at first she would not answer
10,null,null,After a little while
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,as I insisted
13,null,null,she said :  ' ah
14,null,null,well
15,fear,fear,I fear the count is planning a marriage for me
16,null,null,de Chalusse has not said a word to me on the subject
17,null,null,but he has recently had several long conferences in private with a young man whose father rendered him a great service in former years
18,null,null,And this young man
19,null,null,whenever I meet him
20,null,null,looks at me in such a peculiar manner
443 12
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,surprise,The baron 's surprise found vent in a positive distortion of his features
2,null,null,"  Ah
3,null,null,"   said he
4,null,null,in three different tones
5,null,null,"  ah
6,null,null,ah
7,null,null,"   And as no one had offered him a seat
8,null,null,he approached an arm chair and took possession of it
9,null,null,exclaiming
10,null,null,"  You will allow me
11,null,null,I trust
12,null,null,Those stairs have put me in such a state
445 14
 (7, 4),(7, 5),
1,null,null,Meanwhile Madame Ferailleur and her son had exchanged significant glances
2,null,null,Their impressions were the same
3,null,null,This man could not be an enemy
4,null,null,When the baron had finished his letter
5,null,null,and had read it aloud
6,null,null,Pascal
7,happiness,deeply moved,who was deeply moved
8,null,null,exclaimed :   "  I do not know how to express my gratitude to you
9,null,null,monsieur
10,null,null,but if you really wish to serve me
11,null,null,pray dont send that note
12,null,null,It would cause you a great deal of trouble and annoyance
13,null,null,and I should none the less be obliged to relinquish the practice of my profession besides
14,null,null,I am especially anxious to be forgotten for a time .  "

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,ashamed,A little ashamed of his indiscretion
2,null,null,the doctor retreated seven or eight steps down the stairs
3,null,null,and then ascended them again
4,null,null,coughing slightly
5,null,null,so as to announce his approach
6,null,null,This time he was heard
7,null,null,for Mademoiselle Marguerite came to the door to meet him
8,null,null,"  Well
9,null,null,"   he inquired .
450 22
 (9, 4),
1,null,null,That was
2,null,null,indeed
3,null,null,what he desired
4,null,null,With the hand that was comparatively free
5,null,null,with the hoarse rattle that was his only voice
6,null,null,de Chalusse answered
7,null,null,"  Yes
8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,with an expression of joy and gratitude,"   and his eyes even turned to Madame Leon with an expression of joy and gratitude
10,null,null,They raised him on his pillows
11,null,null,and brought him a small writing - desk
12,null,null,with some paper
13,null,null,and a pen that had been dipped in ink
14,null,null,But like those around him
15,null,null,he had himself over estimated his strength
16,null,null,if he could move his hand
17,null,null,he could not CONTROL its movements
18,null,null,After a terrible effort and intense suffering
19,null,null,however
20,null,null,he succeeded in tracing a few words
21,null,null,the meaning of which it was impossible to understand
22,null,null,It was only with the greatest difficulty that these words could be deciphered  "  My entire fortune give friends against   "   This signified nothing .
451 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,"  My God
2,null,null,"   exclaimed Mademoiselle Marguerite
3,null,null,with a gesture of despair
4,null,null,"  what have I done
5,null,null,I have broken the key
6,fear,feared,I feared the responsibility which would fall upon us all .  "
452 9
 (5, 2),
1,null,null,There was a moment 's stupor the stupor which always follows death
2,null,null,especially when death comes suddenly and unexpectedly
3,null,null,A feeling of mingled wonder
4,null,null,selfishness
5,fear,fear,and fear pervaded the group of servants
6,null,null,"  Yes
7,null,null,it is over
8,null,null,"   muttered the doctor
9,null,null,"  it is all over
453 5
 (1, 4),
1,fear,despair,The concierge was in despair
2,null,null,"  Heavens
3,null,null,"   he exclaimed
4,null,null,"  so the master 's dead
5,null,null,What a misfortune
454 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The clerk had been even less disturbed than the magistrate
2,null,null,He also was blase
3,null,null,having witnessed too many of those frightful and shameless dramas which are enacted at a dead man 's bedside
4,surprise,surprised,to be surprised at anything
5,null,null,If he had deigned to glance at the escritoire
6,null,null,it was only because he was curious to see how small a space would suffice to contain two millions
7,null,null,and then he had begun to calculate how many years he would be obliged to remain a clerk before he could succeed in amassing such a fabulous sum .
455 19
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Indeed
2,null,null,he was persuaded he was sure he would
3,null,null,in fact
4,null,null,have sworn that the Count de Chalusse had taken all the precautions natural in childless men
5,null,null,who have no near relatives to inherit their fortune
6,null,null,or who have placed their interest and affections beyond their family circle
7,null,null,And when he was obliged to abandon his search
8,anger,anger,his gesture indicated anger rather than discouragement
9,null,null,for apparent evidence had not shaken his conviction in the least
10,null,null,So he stood motionless
11,null,null,with his eyes riveted on his ring
12,null,null,as if waiting some miraculous inspiration from it
13,null,null,"  For the count 's only fault
14,null,null,I am sure
15,null,null,was in being too cautious
16,null,null,"   he muttered
17,null,null,"  This is frequently the case
18,null,null,and it would be quite in keeping with the character of this man
19,null,null,judging from what I know of him .  "
456 22
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,"  Never
2,null,null,no never
3,null,null,have I seen such a suspicious and distrustful person as he was
4,null,null,Not in reference to money no
5,null,null,indeed for he left that lying about everywhere
6,null,null,but about his papers
7,null,null,He locked them up with the greatest care
8,fear,feared,as if he feared that some terrible secret might evaporate from them
9,null,null,It was a mania with him
10,null,null,If he had a letter to write
11,null,null,he barricaded his door
12,null,null,as if he were about to commit some horrible crime
13,null,null,More than once have I seen him   "   The words died away on her lips
14,null,null,and she remained motionless and abashed
15,null,null,like a person who has just escaped some great peril
16,null,null,One word more
17,null,null,and involuntarily
18,null,null,without even knowing it
19,null,null,she would have confessed her besetting sin
20,null,null,which was listening at
21,null,null,and peering through
22,null,null,the keyholes of the doors that were closed against her .
457 6
 (3, 4),(3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,On hearing these words
2,null,null,the clerk rose with a cloud on his jovial face
3,disgust,impatiently,He impatiently jingled his bunch of keys
4,null,null,for as the seals are successively affixed
5,null,null,each key is confided to the clerk
6,null,null,to remain in his hands until the seals are removed .
458 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,During play time she often took me on her knee and embraced me with convulsive tenderness
2,null,null,murmuring :  ' dear little one
3,null,null,darling little one
4,null,null,' Sometimes her endearments were irksome to me
5,null,null,but I never allowed her to see it
6,sadness,more sad,for fear of making her still more sad
7,null,null,and in my heart I was content and proud to suffer for and with her
8,null,null,Poor sister
9,null,null,I owe her the only happy hours of my infancy
10,null,null,She was called Sister Calliste .
459 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The only fault the sisters found with me was that I was sullen But such was not really the case
2,sadness,depressed and saddened,I was only sad and resigned Everything around me so depressed and saddened me that I withdrew into myself
3,null,null,and buried all my thoughts and aspirations deep in my heart If I had naturally been a bad child
4,null,null,I scarcely know what would have been the result of this I have often asked myself the question in all sincerity
5,null,null,but I have been unable to reply
6,null,null,for one cannot be an impartial judge respecting one 's self
460 15
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,a miserable foundling
2,null,null,reared by public charity for the generosity which this good gentleman and lady showed in offering to take charge of me and employ me in their workshop I must confess that I could not clearly realize in what this great generosity which he so highly praised consisted
3,null,null,nor did I perceive any reason why I should be particularly grateful Still
4,null,null,to all the conditions imposed upon me
5,null,null,I answered
6,null,null,' yes
7,null,null,yes
8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,greatly pleased,' so heartily that Madame Greloux seemed greatly pleased ' it is evident that the child will be glad to get away
10,null,null,' she said to herself Then the superior began to enumerate the obligations my employers would incur
11,null,null,repeating again and again that I was one of the very best girls in the asylum pious
12,null,null,obedient
13,null,null,and industrious
14,null,null,reading and writing to perfection
15,null,null,and knowing how to sew and embroider as only those who are taught in such institutions can
461 11
 (7, 7),(7, 8),
1,null,null,I was so awed that I had scarcely enough presence of mind to bow to him
2,null,null,He glanced at me coldly
3,null,null,and exclaimed :  ' ah
4,null,null,is this the young girl you were speaking of
5,null,null,' The count 's tone betrayed such disagreeable surprise that the superior was dismayed
6,null,null,She looked at me
7,anger,seemed indignant,and seemed indignant at my more than modest attire
8,null,null,' it 's a shame to allow a child to leave home dressed in this fashion
9,null,null,' she angrily exclaimed
10,null,null,And she almost tore my huge apron off me
11,null,null,and then with her own hands began to arrange my hair as if to display me to better advantage .
463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,null,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,null,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
465 22
 (11, 8),
1,null,null,"  By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own
2,null,null,but he did not speak it
3,null,null,He was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians
4,null,null,and I was often affected to tears by his tenderness
5,null,null,But
6,null,null,although my slightest wish was law
7,null,null,he did not grant me his confidence
8,null,null,the mystery that stood between us was like a wall of ice  Still
9,null,null,I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life
10,null,null,and my mind was regaining its equilibrium
11,disgust,more agitated and excited,when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited
12,null,null,if possible
13,null,null,than on the day of my departure from the asylum
14,null,null,He summoned his valet
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,in a tone that admitted no reply
17,null,null,he exclaimed
18,null,null,' i wish to leave Cannes at once  I must start in less than an hour so procure some post horses instantly
19,null,null,And in answer to my inquiring glance
20,null,null,he said :  ' it must be
21,null,null,It would be folly to hesitate
22,null,null,Each moment increases the peril that threatens us . '
467 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,null,null,The count 's immense fortune frightened him

6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .

 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Her cheeks were crimson now
2,null,null,her eyes were lowered
3,null,null,and she was evidently embarrassed
4,null,null,But suddenly
5,null,null,as if ashamed of her blushes
6,null,null,she proudly raised her head
7,null,null,and said
8,null,null,in a firmer voice :   "  Shall I tell you our simple story
9,null,null,Is it necessary
10,null,null,I should not have concealed anything that has passed from my mother
11,happiness,happy,if I had been so happy as to possess a mother
12,null,null,A few moments ' conversation now and then
13,null,null,the exchange of a few letters
14,null,null,the pressure of a hand through the garden gate
15,null,null,and that is all
16,null,null,Still
17,null,null,I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault :  I have disobeyed the one rule of my life frankness
18,null,null,and I am cruelly punished for doing so .

1,null,null,A few moments ' conversation now and then
2,null,null,the exchange of a few letters
3,null,null,the pressure of a hand through the garden gate
4,null,null,and that is all
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault :  I have disobeyed the one rule of my life frankness
7,null,null,and I am cruelly punished for doing so
8,null,null,I did not tell all this to M
9,null,null,de Chalusse in fact
10,null,null,I dared not
11,sadness,ashamed,I was ashamed of my cowardice
12,null,null,from day to day I vowed that I would confess everything
13,null,null,and yet I procrastinated
14,null,null,I said to myself every night
15,null,null,' it shall be done to-morrow
16,null,null,but when the morrow came I said
17,null,null,' i will give myself another day just one more day
18,null,null,Indeed
19,null,null,my courage failed me when I thought of the count 's aristocratic prejudices
20,null,null,and besides
21,null,null,I knew how ambitious he was for my future .
470 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,surprise,frightened,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,null,null,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .
471 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would certainly have given me
2,null,null,I had his troth
3,null,null,and that sufficed
4,null,null,And it was with a thrill of joy that I said to myself :  ' what does it matter if M
5,anger,angered,de Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive me from his house
6,null,null,It will rather be so much the better
7,null,null,Pascal will protect me . '
473 12
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,She clasped her hands
2,null,null,with a gesture of intense joy and relief
3,null,null,and then sank into an arm chair
4,null,null,murmuring :   "  Oh
5,null,null,thanks
6,null,null,monsieur
7,null,null,thanks
8,null,null,"   For she was thinking of Pascal
9,null,null,and she had feared he might shrink from her when she fully revealed to him her wretched
10,null,null,sorrowful past
11,null,null,of which he was entirely ignorant
12,happiness,reassured her,But the magistrate 's words had reassured her .
474 8
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,Compelled to submit to this disappointment
2,null,null,he returned to the study
3,sadness,discouraged,but he was evidently discouraged
4,null,null,Although he did not consider the mystery insoluble
5,null,null,far from it
6,null,null,he realized that time and research would be required to arrive at a solution
7,null,null,and that the affair was quite beyond his province
8,null,null,One hope alone remained .
476 7
 (3, 4),(3, 7),
1,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite 's weakness vanished
2,null,null,She sprang from her chair
3,anger,indignantly,and indignantly faced the magistrate
4,null,null,"  It is false
5,null,null,"   she cried
6,null,null,vehemently
7,null,null,"  and what that paper says is false as well
477 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,and her faith imparted an almost sublime expression to her face
2,null,null,"  If I was overcome
3,null,null,monsieur
4,null,null,"   she continued
5,surprise,appalled,"  it was only because I was appalled by the audacity of the accusation
6,null,null,How was it possible to make Pascal even SEEM to be guilty of a dishonorable act
7,null,null,This is beyond my powers of comprehension
8,null,null,I am only certain of one thing that he is innocent
9,null,null,If the whole world rose to testify against him
10,null,null,it would not shake my faith in him
11,null,null,and even if he confessed that he was guilty I should be more likely to believe that he was crazed than culpable
478 14
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,She spoke these words with a sort of satisfaction
2,null,null,expecting that the marquis would betray his disappointed covetousness by some significant gesture or exclamation
3,null,null,and she was already prepared to rejoice at his confusion
4,null,null,But her expectations were not realized
5,sadness,slightest dismay or even regret,Instead of evincing the slightest dismay or even regret
6,null,null,de Valorsay drew a long breath
7,null,null,as if a great burden had been lifted from his heart
8,null,null,and his eyes sparkled with apparent delight
9,null,null,"  Then I may venture to speak
10,null,null,"   he exclaimed
11,null,null,with unconcealed satisfaction
12,null,null,"  I will speak
13,null,null,mademoiselle
14,null,null,if you will deign to allow me .  "
479 14
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,"  Courage
2,null,null,my dear
3,null,null,"   he growled
4,null,null,"  courage
5,null,null,dont give way
6,null,null,Follow my example
7,null,null,Look at me
8,null,null,"   So saying he stepped back
9,null,null,and it was really amusing to see the extraordinary effort he made to combine a soldier 's stoicism with a friend 's sorrow
10,surprise,wonder,"  You must wonder at my delay
11,null,null,my dear
12,null,null,"   he resumed
13,null,null,"  but it was not my fault
14,null,null,I was at Madame de Rochecote 's when I was informed that your messenger was at home waiting for me .
480 5
 (1, 5),
1,sadness,sadly,Mademoiselle Marguerite sadly shook her head
2,null,null,"  You are mistaken
3,null,null,General
4,null,null,the count left no will
5,null,null,and has made no provision whatever for me .  "
481 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,"  Quite correct
2,null,null,"   answered the magistrate
3,fear,feared,and then as if he feared that he had gone too far
4,null,null,he added :   "  but draw your own conclusions respecting the matter
5,null,null,You have the whole night before you
6,null,null,We will talk it over again to-morrow
7,null,null,and if I can be of service to you in any way
8,null,null,I shall be only too glad .  "
482 8
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,"  Quite correct
2,null,null,"   answered the magistrate
3,null,null,and then as if he feared that he had gone too far
4,null,null,he added :   "  but draw your own conclusions respecting the matter
5,null,null,You have the whole night before you
6,null,null,We will talk it over again to-morrow
7,null,null,and if I can be of service to you in any way
8,happiness,be only too glad,I shall be only too glad .  "
483 13
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,So saying he closed the door again
2,sadness,overwhelmed,and Marguerite was so overwhelmed by this last and unexpected misfortune
3,null,null,that she could hardly stagger back to the vehicle
4,null,null,"  Gone
5,null,null,"   she murmured
6,null,null,"  gone
7,null,null,without a thought of me
8,null,null,Or does he believe me to be like all the rest
9,null,null,But I will find him again
10,null,null,That man Fortunat
11,null,null,who ascertained addresses for M
12,null,null,de Chalusse
13,null,null,will find Pascal for me .  "
485 19
 (13, 13),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,indeed
3,null,null,m ' sieur
4,null,null,And why not
5,null,null,My poor
6,null,null,good mother has n't been able to work for a year
7,null,null,and who would care for her if I didnt
8,null,null,Certainly not my father
9,null,null,the good-for-nothing scamp
10,null,null,who squandered all the Duke de Sairmeuse 's money without giving us a sou of it
11,null,null,Besides
12,null,null,im like other men
13,fear,anxious,im anxious to be rich
14,null,null,and enjoy myself
15,null,null,I should like to ride in my carriage like other people do
16,null,null,And whenever a gamin
17,null,null,such as I was once
18,null,null,opened the door for ME
19,null,null,I should put a five franc piece in his hand   "
486 15
 (10, 11),
1,null,null,He had expected to find  "  his dear extortion er "   exasperated by his loss
2,null,null,cursing and swearing
3,null,null,and demanding his money but not at all
4,null,null,He found him more gentle and calm
5,null,null,colder and more reserved than ever
6,null,null,brimful of resignation indeed
7,null,null,and preaching submission to the inevitable
8,null,null,"  What can this mean
9,null,null,"   he thought
10,fear,with an anxious heart,with an anxious heart
11,null,null,"  What mischief is the scoundrel plotting now
12,null,null,i 'd wager a thousand to one that he 's forging some thunderbolt to crush me
13,null,null,And
14,null,null,in a haughty tone
15,null,null,he said aloud :
487 19
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But M
2,null,null,Fortunat had resolved to listen to nothing
3,null,null,He wished for no explanations
4,fear,fear,so distrustful was he of himself so much did he fear that his adventurous nature would urge him to incur further risk
5,null,null,He was positively afraid of the Marquis de Valorsay 's eloquence
6,null,null,besides
7,null,null,he knew well enough that the person who consents to listen is at least half convinced
8,null,null,"  Tell me nothing
9,null,null,monsieur
10,null,null,"   he hastily answered
11,null,null,"  it would be useless
12,null,null,I have n't the money
13,null,null,If I had given you ten thousand francs last night
14,null,null,I should have been compelled to borrow them of M
15,null,null,Prosper Bertomy
16,null,null,And even if I had the money
17,null,null,I should still say ' Impossible
18,null,null,Every man has his system his theory
19,null,null,you know .
489 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,As he received high wages
2,null,null,he served passably well
3,null,null,but he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count
4,null,null,He scented some great family secret in the household
5,anger,angry and humiliated,and he felt angry and humiliated that this secret had not been entrusted to his discretion
6,null,null,And if he had discovered nothing
7,null,null,it was because M
8,null,null,de Chalusse had been caution personified
9,null,null,as Madame Leon had declared .
490 18
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,With total disregard of prudence
2,null,null,he talked with inexcusable freedom of the Count de Chalusse
3,null,null,and M
4,null,null,de Valorsay
5,null,null,and especially of his enemy
6,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,"  For it is she
8,anger,exclaimed,"   he exclaimed
9,null,null,rapping on the table with his knife  "  it is she who has taken the missing millions
10,null,null,How she did it
11,null,null,no one will ever know
12,null,null,for she has not an equal in craftiness
13,null,null,but it 's she who has stolen them
14,null,null,im sure of it
15,null,null,I would have taken my oath to that effect before the magistrate
16,null,null,and I would have proved it
17,null,null,too
18,null,null,if he had not taken her part because she 's pretty for she is devilishly pretty .  "
491 23
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,Once more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark :   "  There it is again sufficient to live upon
2,null,null,and I expect to receive it from you
3,null,null,Excellent
4,null,null,Women are remarkable creatures
5,null,null,upon my word
6,null,null,But listen to the rest
7,null,null,' it is absolutely necessary that I should see you as soon as possible
8,null,null,Oblige me
9,null,null,therefore
10,null,null,by calling to-morrow
11,null,null,October 15th
12,null,null,at the Hotel de Homburg
13,null,null,in the Rue du Helder
14,null,null,You will ask for Madame Lucy Huntley
15,null,null,and they will conduct you to me
16,null,null,I shall expect you from three o'clock to six
17,null,null,Come
18,null,null,I implore you
19,null,null,come
20,sadness,painful,It is painful to me to add that if I do not hear from you
21,null,null,I am resolved to demand and OBTAIN no matter what may be the consequences the means which I have
22,null,null,so far
23,null,null,asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands
492 22
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Having finished the letter
2,null,null,Casimir laid it on the table
3,null,null,and poured out a glass full of brandy
4,null,null,which he drained at a single draught
5,null,null,"  And that 's all
6,null,null,"   he remarked
7,null,null,"  No signature not even an initial
8,null,null,It was a so-called respectable woman who wrote that
9,null,null,They never sign their notes
10,null,null,the hussies
11,fear,fear,for fear of compromising themselves
12,null,null,as i 've reason to know
13,null,null,And so saying
14,null,null,he laughed the idiotic laugh of a man who has been drinking immoderate ly
15,null,null,"  If I had time
16,null,null,"   he resumed
17,null,null,"  I should make some inquiries about this Madame Lucy Huntley a feigned name
18,null,null,evidently
19,null,null,I should like to know   But what 's the matter with you
20,null,null,Monsieur Fortunat
21,null,null,You are as pale as death
22,null,null,Are you ill
494 9
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,It is needless to say that M
2,sadness,moved with sympathy,Fortunat was moved with sympathy
3,null,null,he always evinced a respectful sympathy for the woes of others
4,null,null,but in the present instance
5,null,null,his emotion was greatly mitigated by the satisfaction he felt at having succeeded so quickly and so completely
6,null,null,Madame d' argeles had confessed everything
7,null,null,This was indeed a victory
8,null,null,for it must be admitted that he had trembled lest she should deny all
9,null,null,and bid him leave the house .
495 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Fortunat did not know what to reply
2,surprise,surprise,The question took him completely by surprise
3,null,null,and feeling that his answer would have a very considerable influence upon what might follow
4,null,null,he hesitated .
497 6
 (3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,One afternoon
2,null,null,when Bruno came home from school
3,surprise,surprised,he was surprised to find Maria
4,null,null,the family 's maid who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet standing in his bedroom
5,null,null,pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates
6,null,null,even the things he 'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else 's business .
498 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,' what are you doing
2,null,null,' he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster
3,sadness,wasnt happy,for although he wasnt happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions
4,null,null,his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the Way Father spoke to her
5,null,null,' you take your hands off my things . '
499 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars
2,null,null,the butler
3,null,null,was in there
4,null,null,packing her things too
5,sadness,sighed,She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase
6,null,null,followed by Bruno
7,null,null,who wasnt going to let the matter drop without an explanation .
500 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived
2,null,null,He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she could n't have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual
3,sadness,crying,like his own after he 'd been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying .
501 14
 (12, 3),(12, 8),(12, 9),(12, 10),(12, 11),
1,null,null,' what is
2,null,null,' he asked
3,null,null,' am I being sent away
4,null,null,'	' no
5,null,null,not just you
6,null,null,' she said
7,null,null,looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it
8,null,null,We all are
9,null,null,Your father and I
10,null,null,Gretel and you
11,null,null,All four of us
12,sadness,frowned,Bruno thought about this and frowned
13,null,null,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
14,null,null,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .
503 10
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,' and we all have to go too
2,null,null,' asked Bruno
3,null,null,Of course we do
4,null,null,' said Mother
5,null,null,' you would n't want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there
6,null,null,would you
7,null,null,'	' i suppose not
8,null,null,' said Bruno
9,sadness,miss,Father would miss us all terribly if we were n't with him
10,null,null,' she added .
504 5
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,sighed,Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again
2,null,null,It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total
3,null,null,if you included the basement
4,null,null,where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you were n't supposed to use
5,null,null,And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly .
505 9
 (3, 7),(3, 8),
1,null,null,' oh my
2,null,null,' said Mother with a laugh
3,sadness,didnt look happy,although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didnt look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didnt want him to see her face
4,null,null,' yes
5,null,null,Bruno
6,null,null,' she said
7,null,null,' it 's more than a mile away
8,null,null,Quite a lot more than that
9,null,null,in fact . '
509 12
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,' say goodbye to them
2,null,null,' he asked
3,surprise,surprise,staring at her in surprise
4,null,null,' say goodbye to them
5,null,null,' he repeated
6,null,null,spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he 'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet
7,null,null,' say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin
8,null,null,' he continued
9,null,null,his voice coming dangerously close to shouting
10,null,null,which
11,null,null,was not allowed indoors
12,null,null,' but theyre my three best friends for life
512 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,' bruno
2,null,null,that 's enough
3,null,null,' she said
4,null,null,snapping at him now and standing up to show him that she was serious when she said that was enough
5,null,null,' honestly
6,sadness,complaining,only last week you were complaining about how much things have changed here recently . '
513 11
 (10, 7),
1,null,null,' everyone has to do that
2,null,null,' said Mother
3,null,null,' it keeps us safe
4,null,null,And who knows
5,null,null,maybe we 'll be in less danger if we move away
6,null,null,Now
7,null,null,I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing
8,null,null,We dont have as much time to prepare as I would have liked
9,null,null,thanks to some people
10,sadness,sadly,Bruno nodded and walked away sadly
11,null,null,knowing that  ' some people ' was a grown-up 's word for ' father ' and one that he wasnt supposed to use himself .
514 3
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,When he first saw their new house Bruno 's eyes opened wide
2,surprise,his mouth  made the shape of an O,his mouth  made the shape of an O and his arms stretched out at his sides once again
3,null,null,Everything about it seemed to be the exact opposite of their old home and he could n't believe that they were really going to live there .
515 2
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,no one ever laughed,But there was something about the new house that  made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there
2,null,null,that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about .
516 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him
2,anger,shout and scream,something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days
3,null,null,or just make him burst into tears instead .
517 3
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him
2,null,null,something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days
3,sadness,tears,or just make him burst into tears instead .
518 9
 (2, 3),(2, 4),(2, 5),(2, 6),
1,null,null,He could n't understand how this had all come about
2,happiness,content,One day he was perfectly content
3,null,null,playing at home
4,null,null,having three best friends for life
5,null,null,sliding down banisters
6,null,null,trying to stand on his tiptoes to see right across Berlin
7,null,null,and now he was stuck here in this cold
8,null,null,nasty house with three whispering maids and a waiter who was both unhappy and angry
9,null,null,where no one looked as if they could ever be cheerful again .
519 5
 (5, 2),
1,null,null,' bruno
2,null,null,I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now
3,null,null,' said Mother in an unfriendly voice
4,null,null,and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word
5,sadness,tears,He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he would n't allow them to appear .
520 8
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father 's room opening slightly

7,fear,fear,a cold fear took possession of him

2,null,null,where we sold or exchanged our merchandise
3,null,null,and one day
4,null,null,when the wind dropped suddenly
5,null,null,we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow
6,null,null,which only rose slightly above the surface of the water
7,null,null,Our sails were furled
8,null,null,and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves
9,null,null,I was among the number
10,null,null,but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us
11,null,null,we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island
12,null,null,while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives
13,null,null,since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale
14,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
15,null,null,others sprang into the sea
16,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
17,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
18,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
19,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
20,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
21,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
22,null,null,now beaten this way
23,null,null,now that
24,sadness,despaired,and when night fell I despaired for my life
25,null,null,but
26,null,null,weary and spent as I was
27,null,null,I clung to my frail support
28,null,null,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island .

4,null,null,and snatched the paper from the man who held it
5,null,null,At first they all thought I was going to throw it into the sea
6,null,null,but they were quieted when they saw I held it with great care

9,null,null,and I have only a few moments to live
10,null,null,This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest
11,null,null,It was the last struggle of the genius
12,null,null,and up to that time I was quite safe
13,null,null,But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire
14,null,null,and in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I knew more than he did
15,null,null,He is dead and in ashes
16,null,null,but my own death is approaching fast

4,null,null,who was even more beautiful than the other two

14,null,null,and when it was emptied
15,null,null,paid him handsomely for its use
16,null,null,But instead of taking up his basket and going away
17,null,null,the man still lingered
18,null,null,till Zobeida inquired what he was waiting for
19,null,null,and if he expected more money
20,null,null,"  Oh

23,null,null,"  you have already given me too much

28,null,null,A company of women without men is
29,null,null,however
30,null,null,as dull as a company of men without women

4,null,null,though in reality he was bright . The other children called him a  "  sissy
5,null,null,"   mistaking his conscientiousness for cowardice  .  This grieved him very much

1,null,null,The anger emotion is aroused by a thwarting of the instincts and purposes

5,anger,anger,else failure or social dislike awaits the choleric  .  When a man wins success he frequently allows himself the luxury of indulging his anger because he feels his power cannot be challenged  .  The Duchess in  "  Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland

7,null,null,is a caricature
8,null,null,and a very apt one
9,null,null,of this type of person . We think of the bull necked Henry the Eighth  "  bluff King Hal "   as the choleric type
10,null,null,though here we also assume a certain cyclothymia

5,null,null,"   Akin to anger
6,null,null,akin to fear
7,null,null,is suspicion . There is a sullen non-social personality type whose reactions are characterized by suspicion . He never willingly gives his trust to any one

10,null,null,he is consumed with dread

7,null,null,in order to do this
8,null,null,it was only needful to turn the screw the reverse way
9,null,null,but

10,null,null,I was about to discuss the matter
11,null,null,when
12,null,null,remembering the argument yesterday

16,fear,feared,I said I feared we were not quite grand enough for him
17,null,null,Carrie said there was  "  no offence in asking him
18,null,null,I said :    "  Certainly not
19,null,null,"   and I wrote him a letter
20,null,null,Carrie confessed she was a little disappointed with Daisy Mutlar 's appearance
21,null,null,but thought she seemed a nice girl .
813 12
 (3, 3),

4,null,null,carped at and criticised the arrangements
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,in fact
7,null,null,disapproved of everything
8,null,null,including our having asked our old friend Cummings
9,null,null,who
10,null,null,he said
11,null,null,would look in evening dress like a green grocer engaged to wait
12,null,null,and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one .
814 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,At ten o'clock we went down to supper
2,null,null,and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month
3,null,null,I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr
4,null,null,Perkupp should come by mere chance
5,null,null,Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of champagne
6,null,null,and drinking it straight off
7,null,null,He repeated this action
8,fear,fear,and made me fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out
9,null,null,I tried to keep a bottle back
10,null,null,but Lupin got hold of it
11,null,null,and took it to the side table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar .

1,null,null,She replied

6,null,null,two more of Lupin 's coloured shirts have run and he says he wont wear them .  "
818 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening
2,null,null,and Cummings never does
3,fear,fear,I fear they dont get on well with Lupin .

4,null,null,Mr Perkupp added
5,null,null,he would let me know to-morrow what the salary would be
6,null,null,This means another day 's anxiety
7,null,null,I dont mind
8,null,null,for it is anxiety of the right sort
9,null,null,That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the letter I received from Mr Mutlar
10,null,null,senr
11,null,null,I broached the subject to Lupin in the evening
12,null,null,having first consulted Carrie
13,null,null,Lupin was riveted to the FINANCIAL NEWS
14,null,null,as if he had been a born capitalist
15,null,null,and I said :    "  Pardon me a moment
16,null,null,Lupin
17,null,null,how is it you have not been to the mutlars ' any day this week
820 18
 (4, 4),

2,null,null,he said :    "  My dear parents
3,null,null,I have some news
4,fear,fear,which I fear will affect you considerably
5,null,null,"    I felt a qualm come over me
6,null,null,and said nothing
7,null,null,Lupin then said :    "  It may distress you - in fact
8,null,null,im sure it will - but this afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for ever
9,null,null,It may seem absurd
10,null,null,but I was so pleased
11,null,null,I immediately opened a bottle of port
12,null,null,Gowing dropped in just in time
13,null,null,bringing with him a large sheet
14,null,null,with a print of a tailless donkey
15,null,null,which he fastened against the wall
16,null,null,He then produced several separate tails
17,null,null,and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper place
18,null,null,My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to bed .
821 13
 (12, 13),
1,null,null,In the evening Lupin arrived home early
2,null,null,and seemed a little agitated
3,null,null,I said :    "  What 's up
4,null,null,my boy
5,null,null,"    He hesitated a good deal
6,null,null,and then said :    "  You know those Parachikka Chlorates I advised you to invest 20 pounds in
7,null,null,I replied :    "  Yes
8,null,null,they are all right
9,null,null,I trust

9,null,null,He had an uncanny faculty for getting appreciative hearings

29,null,null,which included the sale of the shoe business
30,null,null,there being no desire on anybody 's part to contest her right to all the property
31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house
33,null,null,and was considered a charming and interesting widow .
828 13
 (7, 11),
1,null,null,Meanwhile he called on Mrs
2,null,null,Semple
3,null,null,and the more he called the better he liked her
4,null,null,There was no exchange of brilliant ideas between them
5,null,null,but he had a way of being comforting and social when he wished
6,null,null,He advised her about her business affairs in so intelligent a way that even her relatives approved of it
7,happiness,came to like,She came to like him
8,null,null,because he was so considerate
9,null,null,quiet
10,null,null,reassuring
11,null,null,and so ready to explain over and over until everything was quite plain to her
12,null,null,She could see that he was looking on her affairs quite as if they were his own
13,null,null,trying to make them safe and secure .
829 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars
2,null,null,This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right
3,null,null,and he knew exactly what to do with it
4,fear,panic,A panic had come since Mr Semple had died
5,null,null,which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was
6,null,null,There was really a severe business depression .
830 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Next day I joined Grant once more
2,null,null,and found he had collected a few Sorombo men
3,null,null,hoping to follow after me
4,null,null,I then told him all my mishaps in Sorombo
5,fear,frights,as well as of the  "  blue devil "   frights that had seized all my men
6,null,null,I felt greatly alarmed about the prospects of the expedition
7,null,null,scarcely knowing what I should do
8,null,null,I resolved at last
9,null,null,if everything else failed
10,null,null,to make up a raft at the southern end of the N'yanza
11,null,null,and try to go up to the Nile in that way .
831 11
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,These separations from Grant were most annoying
2,null,null,but they could not be helped
3,null,null,so
4,null,null,when all was settled here
5,null,null,I bade him adieu  both of us saying we would do our best and set out on my journey
6,fear,terrible,thinking what a terrible thing it was I could not prevail on my men to view things as I did
7,null,null,Neither my experience with native chiefs
8,null,null,nor my money and guns
9,null,null,were of any use to me
10,null,null,simply because my men were such incomprehensible fools
11,null,null,though many of them who had travelled before ought to have known better .
832 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When within a few miles of the palace we were ordered to stop and wait for Kachuchu 's return
2,null,null,but no sooner put up in a plaintain grove
3,null,null,where pombe was brewing
4,null,null,and our men were all taking a suck at it
5,null,null,than the worthy arrived to call us on the same instant
6,fear,anxious,as the king was most anxious to see us
7,null,null,The love of good beer of course made our men all too tired to march again
833 18
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,More reports came to us about Suwarora
2,null,null,all of the most inviting nature
3,null,null,but nothing else worth mentioning occurred until we reached the border of Msalala
4,null,null,where an officer of M'yonga 's
5,null,null,who said he was a bigger man than his chief
6,null,null,demanded a tax
7,null,null,which I refused
8,null,null,and the dispute ended in his snatching Nasib 's gun out of his hands
9,null,null,I thought little of this affair myself
10,sadness,regretting,beyond regretting the delay which it might occasion
11,null,null,as M'yonga
12,null,null,I knew
13,null,null,would not permit such usage
14,null,null,if I chose to go round by his palace and make a complaint
15,null,null,Both Bui and Nasib
16,null,null,however
17,null,null,were so greatly alarmed
18,null,null,that before I could say a word they got the gun back again by paying four yards merikani .
834 14
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Lumeresi
2,null,null,on hearing this
3,null,null,first consulted me
4,disgust,displeased,saying his chief was displeased with him
5,null,null,accusing him of being too proud
6,null,null,in having at once two such distinguished guests
7,null,null,and meant by these acts only to humble him
8,null,null,I replied
9,null,null,if that was the case
10,null,null,the sooner he allowed us to go
11,null,null,the better it would be for him
12,null,null,and
13,null,null,reminding him of his original promise to give me assistance on to Usui
14,null,null,said he could do so now with a very good grace .
835 14
 (13, 14),
1,null,null,His badges of office he had tied on his head
2,null,null,the butt of a shell
3,null,null,representing the officer 's badge
4,null,null,being fixed on the forehead
5,null,null,whilst a small sheep 's horn
6,null,null,fixed jauntily over the temple
7,null,null,denoted that he was a magician
8,null,null,Wishing to try my powers in magical arts
9,null,null,as I laughed at his church
10,null,null,he begged me to produce an everlasting spring of water by simply scratching the ground
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,drew short up
13,happiness,delight,to the intense delight of my men
14,null,null,on my promising that I would do so if he made one first .
836 15
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,This night one was shot
2,null,null,without any mistake about it
3,null,null,for the next morning we tracked him by his blood
4,null,null,and afterwards heard he had died of his wound
5,null,null,The Wasui elders
6,null,null,contrary to my expectation
7,null,null,then came and congratulated us on our success
8,happiness,wonderful,They thought us most wonderful men
9,null,null,and possessed of supernatural powers
10,null,null,for the thief in question was a magician
11,null,null,who until now was thought to be invulnerable
12,null,null,Indeed
13,null,null,they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people
14,null,null,but though they had so many more guns than ourselves
15,null,null,they never succeeded in killing one .
837 8
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Nasib then returned to inform us that the king had heard our complaint
2,sadness,sorry,and was sorry for it
3,null,null,but said he could not interfere with the rights of his officers
4,null,null,He did not wish himself to take anything from us
5,null,null,and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted
6,null,null,Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers
7,null,null,and begged us to have patience
8,null,null,for he was then fleecing Masudi at the encamping ground near the palace .
838 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Early in the morning we were on foot again
2,happiness,thankful,only too thankful to have got off so cheaply
3,null,null,Then men were appointed as guides and protectors
4,null,null,to look after us as far as the border
5,null,null,What an honour
6,null,null,We had come into the country drawn there by a combination of pride and avarice and now we were leaving it in hot haste under the guidance of an escort of officers
7,null,null,who were in reality appointed to watch us as dangerous wizards and objects of terror .
839 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Whilst Baraka 's arguments all rested the other way
2,null,null,that no one could tell what was ahead of him Bana had sold himself to luck and the devil but though he did not care for his own safety
3,disgust,fools,he ought not to sacrifice the lives of others Bombay and his lot were fools for their pains in trusting to him .
841 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu ( men eaters )
2,null,null,who disdained all food but human flesh
3,null,null,and Rumanika confirmed the statement
4,disgust,sceptical,Though I felt very sceptical about it
5,null,null,I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick 's Nyam Nyams ( men eaters ) .
843 14
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Next day
2,null,null,after crossing more of those abominable rush drains
3,null,null,whilst in sight of the Victoria N'yanza
4,happiness,beautiful,we ascended the most beautiful hills
5,null,null,covered with verdure of all descriptions
6,null,null,At Meruka
7,null,null,where I put up
8,null,null,there resided some grandees
9,null,null,the chief of whom was the king 's aunt
10,null,null,She sent me a goat
11,null,null,a hen
12,null,null,a basket of eggs
13,null,null,and some plantains
14,null,null,in return for which I sent her a wire and some beads .
844 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .
845 13
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,I then ( 16th ) very much wished to go and see the escape of the Mwerango river
2,disgust,sceptical,as I still felt a little sceptical as to its origin
3,null,null,whether or not it came off those smaller lakes I had seen on the road the day before I crossed the river
4,null,null,but no one would listen to my project
5,null,null,They all said I must have the king 's sanction first
6,null,null,else people
7,null,null,from not knowing my object
8,null,null,would accuse me of practising witchcraft
9,null,null,and would tell their king so
10,null,null,They still all maintained that the river did come out of the lake
11,null,null,and said
12,null,null,if I liked to ask the king 's leave to visit the spot
13,null,null,then they would go and show it me .
846 15
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,The day was now gone
2,null,null,so torches were lit
3,null,null,and we were ordered to go
4,null,null,though as yet I had not been able to speak one word I wished to impart about Petherick and Grant
5,fear,afraid,for my interpreters were so afraid of the king they dared not open their mouths until they were spoken to
6,null,null,The king was now rising to go
7,null,null,when
8,null,null,in great fear and anxiety that the day would be lost
9,null,null,I said
10,null,null,in Kisuahili
11,null,null,"  I wish you would send a letter by post to Grant
12,null,null,and also send a boat up the Kitangule
13,null,null,as far as Rumanika 's palace
14,null,null,for him
15,null,null,for he is totally unable to walk .  "
847 13
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The pages dreaded their master 's wrath
2,null,null,departed for a while
3,sadness,sorry,and then sent another lad to tell me he was sorry to hear I felt unwell
4,null,null,but he hoped I would come if only for a minute
5,null,null,bringing my medicines with me
6,null,null,for he himself felt pain
7,null,null,That this second message was a forged one I had no doubt
8,null,null,for the boys had not been long enough gone
9,null,null,still
10,null,null,I packed up my medicines and went
11,null,null,leaving the onus
12,null,null,should any accident happen
13,null,null,upon the mischievous story bearers .
848 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I then sent Bombay to see the queen
2,null,null,to ask after her health
3,null,null,beg for a hut in the palace enclosures
4,null,null,and say I should have gone myself
5,fear,feared,only I feared her gate might be shut
6,null,null,and I cannot go backwards and forwards so far in the sun without a horse or an elephant to ride upon
7,null,null,She begged I would come next morning .
849 16
 (9, 11),
1,null,null,5th
2,null,null,Alarmed at having got involved in something that looked like court intrigues
3,null,null,I called up N'yamgundu
4,null,null,told him all that happened yesterday
5,null,null,both at the two courts and with Maula at home
6,null,null,and begged him to apply to the king for a meeting of five elders
7,null,null,that a proper understanding might be arrived at
8,null,null,but instead of doing as I desired
9,sadness,terrible,he got into a terrible fright
10,null,null,calling Maula
11,null,null,and told me if I pressed the matter in this way men would lose their lives
12,null,null,Meanwhile the cunning blackguard Maula begged for pardon
13,null,null,said I quite misunderstood his meaning
14,null,null,all he had said was that I was very fortunate
15,null,null,being in such favour at court
16,null,null,for the king and queen both equally loved me .
850 19
 (12, 11),
1,null,null,These Wakungu
2,null,null,having only just then returned from plundering Unyoro
3,null,null,had never before seen their king in a chair
4,null,null,or anybody sitting
5,null,null,as I was
6,null,null,by his side
7,null,null,and it being foreign to their notions
8,null,null,as well as
9,null,null,perhaps
10,null,null,unpleasant to their feelings
11,null,null,to find a stranger sitting higher than themselves
12,sadness,complained,they complained against this outrage to custom
13,null,null,and induced the king to order my dethronement
14,null,null,The result was
15,null,null,as my iron stool was objectionable
16,null,null,I stood for a moment to see that I thoroughly understood their meaning
17,null,null,and then showing them my back
18,null,null,walked straightway home to make a grass throne
19,null,null,and dodge them that way .
851 8
 (5, 1),(5, 4),
1,null,null,This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight
2,null,null,for my cows were eaten up
3,null,null,and my men clamouring incessantly for food
4,null,null,and though they might by orders help themselves  "  ku n'yangania "   by seizing from the Waganda
5,sadness,hurt,it hurt my feelings so much to witness this
6,null,null,that I tried from the first to dispense with it
7,null,null,telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing
8,null,null,and now he turned them into a pack of thieves .
853 5
 (5, 1),
1,null,null,M Fortunat 's gaze was so intent that it became unbearable
2,null,null,"  You see
3,null,null,then
4,null,null,"   he began
5,fear,fear,"  that I had good cause to fear  "
855 10
 (1, 1),
1,fear,sudden terror,"  I was stupefied and alarmed by the sudden terror which M de Chalusse had displayed and could not control
2,null,null,What could it all mean
3,null,null,What sorrowful recollections
4,null,null,what mysterious apprehensions
5,null,null,had my words aroused in the count 's mind
6,null,null,I could not understand or imagine why he should regard my question as strange or unnatural
7,null,null,On the contrary
8,null,null,I thought it perfectly natural
9,null,null,dictated as it had been by circumstances
10,null,null,and by the count 's own words and manner .
857 6
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,Steve goes in to pitch him
2,disgust,could n't stand him,but Joe could n't stand him
3,null,null,Alcorn recalled
4,null,null,He didnt appreciate Steve 's hygiene
5,null,null,Jobs was barefoot
6,null,null,and at one point put his feet up on a desk .
858 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,But Apple was my baby
2,null,null,and I didnt want to give it up
3,sadness,was agonizing to,Relinquishing any control was agonizing to him .
859 6
 (6, 3),
1,null,null,Sculley recalled
2,null,null,Most of them thought it was the worst commercial they had ever seen
3,null,null,Sculley himself got cold feet
4,null,null,He asked Chiat Day to sell off the two commercial spots  one sixty seconds
5,null,null,the other thirty  that they had purchased
6,anger,beside,bs was beside himself .
860 1
 (1, 1),
1,anger,bristle,He would later bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his adoptive parents or implied that they were not his real parents .

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She was something sure and pleasant in a world that swayed and was uncertain
2,happiness,happy,He was drunk enough to feel happy so long as he was not scolded
3,null,null,He dreaded the moment when his brother Charles would appear
4,null,null,and he strove to arrange in his mind the wise and unanswerable word with which he would defend himself
5,null,null,but his thoughts slipped just as the firelight slipped and the floors with the old threadbare carpet .
867 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She did not pretend to care for her father
2,sadness,lonely,she was very lonely because the villagers hated him
3,null,null,but she had always made the best of everything because she had never had an intimate friend to tell her that that was a foolish thing to do .
868 7
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,She could not pretend that she was sorry that her father had died
2,sadness,missed,and yet she missed him because she knew very well that she was now no one 's business
3,null,null,that she was utterly and absolutely alone in the universe
4,null,null,It might be said that she could not be utterly alone when she had her Uncle Mathew
5,null,null,but
6,null,null,although she was ignorant of life
7,null,null,she knew her Uncle Mathew
869 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,He was rather pathetic
2,null,null,having drunk nothing out of respect to the occasion
3,null,null,he felt
4,null,null,somewhere deep down in him
5,null,null,a persistent exaltation that his brother Charles was dead
6,sadness,anxious,but he knew that it was not decent to allow this feeling to conquer him and he was truly anxious to protect and comfort his niece so well as he was able
7,null,null,Early in the afternoon he suggested that they should go for a walk .
872 11
 (11, 3),(11, 4),(11, 5),(11, 6),
1,null,null,She would have loved him had he allowed her
2,null,null,and because he did not she bore him no grudge
3,null,null,She had always regarded her life
4,null,null,sterile and unprofitable as it was
5,null,null,with humour until now when
6,null,null,like a discarded dress
7,null,null,it had slipped behind her
8,null,null,She did not see it
9,null,null,even now
10,null,null,with bitterness
11,happiness,there was no bitterness,there was no bitterness for anything in her character .
875 5
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,All this was very fascinating to Maggie who was of a practical mind with regard to the facts immediately before her but had beyond them a lively imagination
2,sadness,lonely,Her life had been so lonely
3,null,null,spent for the most part so far from children of her own age
4,null,null,that she had no test of reality
5,null,null,She did not see any reason why the Lord God should not come again and she saw every reason why her aunts should condemn her uncle .
876 3
 (1, 1),
1,anger,sulky,Today Maggie 's abrupt checking of his projects had made him sulky and he talked but little
2,null,null,"  Damn it all
3,null,null,"   he had started out with the most charming intentions towards the girl and now look at her
877 10
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,Had she been pretty he might have
2,null,null,even now
3,null,null,forgiven her
4,null,null,but today she looked especially plain with her pale face and shabby black dress and her obstinate mouth and chin
5,sadness,uneasy,He was uneasy
6,null,null,too
7,null,null,about the imminent arrival of his sister Anne
8,null,null,who always frightened him and made him think poorly of the world in general

 (1, 1),
1,disgust,hated,She hated that he should call her Miss Maggie
2,null,null,He had always treated her with considerable respect

 (2, 5),
1,null,null,Her lips quivered
2,sadness,was near tears,again she was near tears

4,null,null,as it had been on her walk with Uncle Mathew
5,null,null,her regret was not for her father but for the waste that her life with him had been

3,null,null,as she watched them
4,surprise,surprised,was surprised to feel within herself a certain sympathy with her uncle
5,null,null,Aunt Anne 's greeting was gentle and kind but infinitely distant

2,null,null,"  After all

6,null,null,She was puzzled .
890 16
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In part because she had always been so reserved a child

3,null,null,she had always placed an intensity of feeling around and about the few things that were hers
4,null,null,Her library was very small

894 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The rest of the interview came to her only dimly
2,null,null,She knew that Uncle Mathew was still upon his feet protesting
3,surprise,surprise,that her aunt 's face was cold and wore a look of distressed surprise as though some one had suddenly been rude to her .
895 5
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Mathew was uncomfortable now
2,null,null,His mood had changed
3,sadness,sullen,he was sullen
4,null,null,His sister always made him feel like a disgraced dog
5,null,null,He shuffled on his feet .
896 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,She chose instinctively her path
2,null,null,through the kitchen garden at the back of the village
3,null,null,down the hill by the village street
4,null,null,over the little bridge that crossed the rocky stream of the Dreot
5,null,null,and up the steep hill that led on to the outskirts of Rothin Moor
6,null,null,The day
7,null,null,although she had no eyes for it
8,surprise,surprise,was one of those sudden impulses of misty warmth that surprise the Glebeshire frosts
9,null,null,The long stretch of the moor was enwrapped by a thin silver network of haze
10,null,null,the warmth of the sun
11,null,null,seen so dimly that it was like a shadow reflected in a mirror
12,null,null,struck to the very heart of the soil .
897 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,disgust,Her first thought as she went forward was disgust at her own weakness
2,null,null,once again she had been betrayed by her feelings
3,null,null,She could remember no single time when they had not betrayed her .
899 8
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,it 's bad luck
3,sadness,cried,"   she cried
4,null,null,staring distress fully at the old man
5,null,null,He smiled
6,null,null,and would have certainly been very agreeable to her had not Aunt Anne
7,null,null,who had been finding their boxes and securing a cab
8,null,null,arrived and taken Maggie away .

901 5
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,She stammered something to the man who had held her and then let her go
2,sadness,confused,She was confused
3,null,null,hot and angry
4,null,null,"  they 'll think me an idiot who cant enter a room properly
5,null,null,She glared about her and felt as though she had been taken prisoner by some strange people who lived under the sea .

4,null,null,"  they 'll think me an idiot who cant enter a room properly
5,null,null,She glared about her and felt as though she had been taken prisoner by some strange people who lived under the sea .
905 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Maggie fancied that the three persons were nervous of her aunt
2,happiness,amused,the stout young man was amused perhaps at the general situation
3,null,null,but Mr
4,null,null,Magnus by the fireplace showed great emotion
5,null,null,the colour mounting into his high bony cheeks and his nostrils twitching like a horse 's .
906 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,There was no one in the room
2,null,null,she felt
3,null,null,as she lay there
4,null,null,an increasing irritation at her weakness
5,fear,afraid,She was afraid too for her future
6,null,null,Did she faint like this at the earliest opportunity people would allow her no chance of earning her living .
907 6
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,She stared at her aunt
2,null,null,then at a long mirror that faced her bed
3,null,null,then at the lighted sky
4,happiness,warmly grateful,She felt warmly grateful
5,null,null,eager to show all the world that she would do her best
6,null,null,that she was ready to give herself to this new life with all her soul and strength she could say nothing .
908 13
 (11, 8),(11, 9),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,deep down in her soul
3,null,null,she knew that she wanted success
4,null,null,a magnificent life
5,null,null,a great future
6,null,null,Any more
7,null,null,she expected it
8,null,null,She had force and strength
9,null,null,and she would compel life to give her what she wanted
10,null,null,She laughed at herself in the glass
11,happiness,happy,She was happy
12,null,null,almost triumphant
13,null,null,and for no reason at all .
909 4
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,Fainted right off there in the drawing-room
2,sadness,anxiously,Or her aunts saying anxiously to one another :   "  Well
3,null,null,I didnt know she was as delicate as that
4,null,null,I hope she wont be always ill
910 8
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,She hated sentiment and affectation in any one
2,fear,afraid,She was afraid
3,null,null,too
4,null,null,that Anne bullied Aunt Elizabeth
5,null,null,Maggie was sorry for Aunt Elizabeth but
6,null,null,with all the arrogance of the young
7,null,null,a little despised her
8,null,null,Why did she tremble and start like that
911 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The bird seemed to have come to her
2,null,null,in the friendliest way
3,null,null,to remove some of the chilly passivity of the house
4,fear,fear,Her greatest fear since her arrival had been that this was a house "  in which nothing was ever going to happen
5,null,null,"   and that  "  she would never get out of it .  "
912 12
 (6, 7),(6, 10),(6, 11),
1,null,null,And yet now
2,null,null,as she looked around her
3,null,null,she was not
4,null,null,to her own surprise
5,null,null,disappointed
6,happiness,satisfied,She was even satisfied
7,null,null,the  "  wonder "   was not in the building
8,null,null,Well
9,null,null,then
10,null,null,it must be in something  "  inside "
11,null,null,something that she had yet to discover
12,null,null,The chapel had the thrilling quality of a little plain deal box that carries a jewel .
913 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Aunt Anne walked first and took what was obviously her own regular seat near the front
2,null,null,Maggie sat between her two aunts
3,surprise,surprise,She could not feel for the moment anything but a startled surprise at the ugliness of the building
4,null,null,She had entered at different times the Glebeshire chapels
5,null,null,but their primitive position and need had given them the spirit of honest sincerity .
915 6
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  Thou knowest how we are weak and foolish
2,null,null,our faults are all known to Thee and our blunders are not hid
3,happiness,thank,therefore we thank Thee that Thou hast not been impatient with us
4,null,null,but
5,null,null,seeing that we are but little children in Thy hands
6,null,null,hast deemed the thunderbolt too heavy for our heads and the lightning too blinding for our eyes .
916 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But behind the facility and easy flow of his words Maggie fancied that she detected some urgent insistence that came from the man 's very heart
2,happiness,was moved,She was moved by that as though he were saying to her personally
3,null,null,"  dont heed these outward words of mine
4,null,null,But listen to me myself .
917 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  you 've come to live here
2,null,null,have n't you
3,null,null,"   continued Miss Smith
4,happiness,glad,"  im so glad
5,null,null,I think you look so nice
6,null,null,You dont mind my saying that
7,null,null,do you
8,null,null,I always tell people what I think of them and then one knows where one is .
918 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Miss Smith 's further confidences were interrupted by the aunts and behind them
2,null,null,to Maggie 's great surprise
3,null,null,Mr
4,null,null,Warlock and his son
5,sadness,embarrassed,The sudden descent of these gentlemen upon the still lingering echoes of Miss Caroline Smith 's critical and explanatory remarks embarrassed Maggie .
919 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,His voice was of an extreme kindliness and his eyes
2,null,null,when she looked up at him
3,null,null,shone with friendliness
4,null,null,She found herself
5,surprise,surprise,to her own surprise
6,null,null,talking to him with great ease
7,null,null,He was perfectly simple
8,null,null,human and unaffected
9,null,null,He asked her about her country .
920 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,He had seen her old hands tremble with suppressed temper on the very day after his arrival
2,anger,anger,he had seen her old lips white with anger because the maid had brought her the wrong shawl
3,null,null,Old ladies must of course have their fancies
4,null,null,but his mother had some fixed and fierce purpose in her life that was quite beyond his powers of penetration .
922 6
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,Her fear was of Martin
2,null,null,She feared very deeply his influence upon her husband
3,null,null,During Martin 's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it
4,null,null,John Warlock
5,null,null,the master
6,null,null,had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body .

1,null,null,Her fear was of Martin
2,fear,feared,She feared very deeply his influence upon her husband
3,null,null,During Martin 's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it
4,null,null,John Warlock
5,null,null,the master
6,null,null,had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body .
924 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She had seen before in earlier days the force of her husband 's passion when it was roused
2,fear,terrified,There was something now in his reception of their son that terrified her
3,null,null,She had at once perceived that Amy was as deeply moved as she .
925 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Such things could not frighten
2,fear,dismay,of course he was no longer a child and yet because he had once been frightened some impression of alarm and dismay hovered over him .
926 11
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,"  Father
2,sadness,disappointed,youll be badly disappointed in me
3,null,null,i 've been feeling it coming all the time
4,null,null,I cant help it
5,null,null,im just like any one else
6,null,null,I want to have a good time
7,null,null,One 's only young once
8,null,null,im awfully sorry
9,null,null,I want to please you in any way I can
10,null,null,but but it 's all gone all that early part
11,null,null,It 's simply one 's childhood that 's finished with .  "
927 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  I might not have come
2,surprise,surprised,"   Martin said with a sudden anger that surprised himself
3,null,null,"  She made no conditions
4,null,null,I might have gone on with my life there abroad
5,null,null,I am free to lead my own life where and how I please .  "
928 9
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,What did Martin remember
2,null,null,He remembered a good deal
3,surprise,surprised,He was surprised when he began to think
4,null,null,"  Did he remember
5,null,null,his father suggested a scene
6,null,null,a day yes
7,null,null,he remembered that
8,null,null,His father continued
9,null,null,as though it had been for his own pleasure .
929 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He could see Mason Street with its grocer 's shop at the corner
2,null,null,its Baths and Public Library
3,null,null,the sudden little black dips into the areas as the houses followed one another
4,happiness,excited,the lamp-post opposite their window that had always excited him because it leaned inwards a little as though it would presently tumble
5,null,null,He remembered the fat short cook with the pink cotton dress who wheezed and blew so when she had to climb the stairs .
930 4
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,What a little prig and yet how simple it had all been
2,null,null,without any consciousness of insincerity or acting on his part
3,null,null,God had chosen him and there he was
4,happiness,happy,for ever and ever safe and happy .
931 11
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then when at last she had mounted the vehicle she would flood the conductor with a stream of little questions
2,null,null,darting her eyes angrily at all her neighbours as though they were gathered there together to murder her at the earliest opportunity
3,sadness,confused,She would be desperately confused when asked to pay for her ticket
4,null,null,would be unable to find her purse
5,null,null,and then when she discovered it would scatter its contents upon the ground
6,null,null,In such an agony would she be at the threatened passing of her destination that she would spring up at every pause of the omnibus
7,null,null,striking her nearest neighbour 's eye or nose with her umbrella
8,null,null,apologising nervously
9,null,null,and then
10,null,null,because she thought she had been too forward with a stranger
11,null,null,staring fiercely about her and daring any one to speak to her .
933 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Her attitude was one of surprised excitement
2,surprise,amazed,She was amazed by the most ordinary incidents and conversations
3,null,null,She found Maggie 's life quite incredible .
934 12
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,She had been trained in another school from Caroline
2,null,null,she felt from the very first that upon certain questions her lovely friend was inexperienced
3,null,null,foolish and dangerously reckless
4,null,null,On the question of  "  men
5,null,null,"   for instance
6,null,null,Maggie
7,null,null,with clear knowledge of her father and her uncle
8,null,null,refused to follow Caroline 's light and easy excursions
9,sadness,disappointed,Caroline was disappointed
10,null,null,she had a great deal to say on the subject and could speak
11,null,null,she assured Maggie
12,null,null,from a vast variety of experience :   "  Men are all the same .
935 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Maggie soon discovered that Mr
2,happiness,happy,Magnus was very happy to sit in their house even though Aunt Anne was not present
3,null,null,His attitude seemed to be that the atmosphere that she left behind her was enough for him and that he could not
4,null,null,in justice
5,null,null,expect any more .
936 10
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,here 's your question
4,null,null,Miss Cardinal
5,null,null,Why on earth did I go on writing
6,null,null,Simply because I could n't help myself
7,happiness,happiness,Writing was the only thing in the world that gave me happiness
8,null,null,I thought too that there might be people
9,null,null,here and there
10,null,null,unknown to me who cared for what I did .
937 8
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,impatience,I realised that by nine out of every ten men and five out of every ten women the literary page in the paper is turned over with exactly the same impatience with which I turn over the betting columns
2,null,null,Anyway
3,null,null,why not
4,null,null,perfectly right
5,null,null,And then by this time i 'd seen my old books
6,null,null,often enough
7,null,null,lying scattered amongst dusty piles in second hand shops marked
8,null,null,' all this lot 6d . '
938 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The young man was apparently in love with a lady much older than himself
2,null,null,who wore pince-nez
3,surprise,surprise,but it was an arid kind of love in which the young man discovered motives and symptoms with the same dexterous surprise with which he discovered newts and tadpoles in the cellar pond
4,null,null,Maggie bravely attacked Mr
5,null,null,Magnus .
939 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He had an irritating habit of never finishing his sentences
2,null,null,and the people he knew answered him in the same inconclusive fashion
3,anger,annoyed,The pool in the cellar naturally annoyed him
4,null,null,but he did nothing very practical about it
5,null,null,allowed it to remain there
6,null,null,and discussed it with a Professor of Chemistry .
940 7
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,This was beyond Maggie altogether
2,happiness,agreeable,An agreeable thing
3,null,null,however
4,null,null,about Mr
5,null,null,Magnus was that he did not mind when you disliked his work
6,null,null,He seemed to expect that you would not like it
7,null,null,He was certainly a very un conceited man .
941 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I could n't imagine what they were all about
2,null,null,it wasnt the ordinary London congregation
3,null,null,it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite
4,happiness,excitement,there was an air of expectation and even excitement which is most unusual in a London church
5,null,null,Then there was Warlock
6,null,null,Of course one could see at once that he was an extraordinary man
7,null,null,a kind of prophet all on his own
942 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Oh yes
2,null,null,one of them went back
3,null,null,I remember
4,sadness,disappointing,But his actual meeting with his girl was so disappointing in comparison with his long expectation of it in front of the Temple that he took the next boat back to the island
5,null,null,but he never found it again
6,null,null,He travelled everywhere and died
7,null,null,a disappointed man
8,null,null,at sea .  "
943 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,What was there then in Maggie that started up in rebellion at this unexpected declaration
2,null,null,She had been sitting there
3,null,null,tranquil
4,happiness,happy,soothed with a happy sense that her new life was developing securely for her in the way that she would have it
5,null,null,Suddenly she was alert
6,null,null,suspicious
7,null,null,hostile .
944 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,"  Said
2,null,null,"   he repeated
3,null,null,stammering a little
4,null,null,"  Why only
5,null,null,Nothing
6,null,null,except that she cared for you and hoped that you would be happy
7,fear,afraid,She was afraid that it would all be strange for you at first
8,null,null,Perhaps I have been interfering
946 7
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,"  they 've been to some meeting
2,null,null,She stood looking at him with her fine steady gaze that had always made him afraid of her
3,null,null,and did so
4,surprise,surprise,to his own surprise
5,null,null,again now
6,null,null,He had thought that his clothes would have saved him from that
7,null,null,his fingers felt at his button hole .
947 9
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,"  Why
2,null,null,Mathew
3,null,null,You never told us
4,null,null,I would have hurried back
5,null,null,and now Elizabeth
6,null,null,im afraid
7,null,null,has gone on to see some friends
8,sadness,disappointed,She will be so disappointed
9,null,null,But at least you 've had Maggie to entertain you .  "
949 4
 (1, 2),
1,fear,frightened,For a moment Maggie was frightened
2,null,null,She was here in a strange hotel in a strange room with a man whom she scarcely knew
3,null,null,Then she looked up into young Warlock 's face and was reassured
4,null,null,She could trust him .
950 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,on his side
2,null,null,as he looked down at her
3,surprise,surprised,was surprised at his own excitement
4,null,null,His heart was beating
5,null,null,his hand trembling before this plain
6,null,null,ordinary
7,null,null,unattractive girl
951 6
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,One of the most interesting human beings whom he had ever met
2,null,null,simply because she was utterly unlike any one else
3,sadness,shame,He felt shame before her
4,null,null,because he knew that she would believe every word that he said
5,null,null,In that she was simple
6,null,null,but  "  he would be bothered if she was simple in anything else .  "

5,null,null,She had made up her mind he knew it as well as though she had told him to trust him absolutely
6,null,null,and he knew well enough how little he was to be trusted .
953 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Amy hated him
2,null,null,his mother hid herself from him
3,fear,frightened,and his father 's love frightened him
4,null,null,Already he had found himself telling lies to avoid the chapel services and the meetings with Thurston and the rest .
954 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He took a chair close to her and sat down
2,null,null,who had known in his time many women
3,null,null,could see how happy she was
4,happiness,excited,That happiness excited him
5,null,null,Suddenly he held her hand
6,null,null,She did not remove it .
955 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,"  Look here
2,null,null,"   he began
3,surprise,surprised,and he was surprised at the hoarseness of his voice
4,null,null,"  your uncle will be back in a moment
5,null,null,and we never have a chance of being alone
6,null,null,i 've wanted to talk to you ever since I first saw you .  "

5,null,null,perhaps
6,anger,angry,would be angry
7,anger,sorrow,but the sorrow and anger would be only for a little while
8,null,null,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,null,null,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,null,null,she supposed
11,null,null,also his .
960 11
 (7, 2),
1,null,null,She loved Martin and Martin loved her
2,null,null,Soon Martin would marry her and they would go away
3,null,null,Her aunt would be sorry of course
4,null,null,and his father
5,null,null,perhaps
6,null,null,would be angry
7,anger,anger,but the sorrow and anger would be only for a little while

9,null,null,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,null,null,she supposed
11,null,null,also his .
961 8
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Maggie felt as though she could see the firelight through her body
2,null,null,and with that came also the conviction that Aunt Anne knew everything
3,null,null,knew about Martin and the posted letter and the thoughts of escape
4,null,null,Maggie herself was tired with the trial of her waiting day
5,sadness,exhausted,she was exhausted and was beating
6,null,null,with all her resolve
7,null,null,against a disappointment that hammered with a thundering noise
8,null,null,somewhere far away in the recesses of her soul .
963 5
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,despair,"  I sometimes despair of you
2,null,null,Maggie
3,null,null,You will not think of others
4,null,null,I dont wish to be hard or unjust
5,null,null,but selfishness is the name of your greatest weakness .  "
964 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,She had hoped that he would be there
2,null,null,waiting
3,null,null,so that he might have a word with her before they went in
4,sadness,disappointment,but when they were all gathered together under the porch she saw with a throb of disappointment that he was not there
5,null,null,She saw no one whom she knew
6,null,null,but it struck her at once that here was a gathering quite different from that of the first time that she had come to the Chapel .
965 13
 (10, 3),(10, 5),(10, 6),(10, 7),(10, 8),(10, 9),
1,null,null,There seemed to be more of the servant class
2,null,null,rather they were older women with serious rapt expressions and very silent
3,null,null,There were men too
4,null,null,to-night
5,null,null,four or five gathered together inside the passage
6,null,null,standing gravely
7,null,null,without a word
8,null,null,not moving
9,null,null,like statues
10,fear,frightened,Maggie was frightened
11,null,null,She felt like a spy in an enemy 's camp
12,null,null,and a spy waiting for an inevitable detection
13,null,null,with no hope of securing any news .
967 10
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Miss avies ' two friends
2,surprise,surprised,huddled and frightened like fledglings suddenly surprised by a cuckoo
3,null,null,stirred Maggie 's sympathy
4,null,null,She disliked Miss Avies from the very first moment
5,null,null,Miss Avies had a pale
6,null,null,thin
7,null,null,pointed face with no eyebrows
8,null,null,grey eyes dim and short-sighted
9,null,null,and fair colourless hair brushed straight back under a hard
10,null,null,ugly black hat .
968 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Maggie could only see his head and shoulders
2,null,null,but she realised at once that he had been
3,null,null,for a long time
4,null,null,trying to catch her eye
5,happiness,happiness,He smiled at her an intimate peculiar smile that sent the blood flooding to her face and made her heart beat with happiness
6,null,null,At the moment of her smiling she realised that Miss avies ' dim eye was upon her .
969 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She set back her shoulders
2,null,null,sat up stiffly
3,null,null,and tried to look as old as she might  that was not
4,null,null,unhappily
5,null,null,very old
6,happiness,happy,That smile exchanged with Martin had made her happy for ever
7,null,null,Miss Avies was of less than no importance at all
970 7
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,excitement,The singing of the hymn roused the excitement of the congregation to even more than its earlier pitch
2,null,null,The tune was a moving one
3,null,null,beginning very softly
4,null,null,beseeching God to listen
5,null,null,then
6,null,null,more confident
7,null,null,rising to a high note of appeal :
971 9
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,a sinner like the rest of you
2,fear,fear,live nevertheless in the fear of hell fire
3,null,null,Hell fire has become
4,null,null,I think
5,null,null,to many of the present generation a mockery and a derision
6,null,null,I come to tell you that it is no mockery
7,null,null,that it as surely lies there
8,null,null,a blazing furnace
9,null,null,in front of us as though we saw it with our own eyes
972 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She wanted to run away from the house
2,null,null,miles and miles and miles
3,null,null,She climbed into bed and thought of her escape
4,null,null,If Miss Trenchard did not answer her letter
5,null,null,then she could go off to Uncle Mathew
6,sadness,disliked,greatly though she disliked the thought of that
7,null,null,then she could live on her three hundred pounds and look about until she found work or Martin came for her .

 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  It was very good of you
2,null,null,dear
3,null,null,to come
4,sadness,ashamed,I felt ashamed to wake you up at such an hour
5,null,null,but I wanted you
6,null,null,I felt that only you must be with me to-night
7,null,null,It was a call from God
8,null,null,I felt that it must be obeyed
9,null,null,Sit down
10,null,null,dear
11,null,null,There
12,null,null,on that chair
13,null,null,you 're not cold
14,null,null,are you
974 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She talked on and on
2,sadness,confused,sometimes her sentences were confused and unfinished
3,null,null,sometimes they seemed to Maggie to have no meaning
4,null,null,once or twice the voice dropped so low that Maggie did not catch the words
5,null,null,but always there was especial urgency behind the carelessness as though every word were being spoken for a listener 's benefit a listener who sat perhaps with pencil and notebook somewhere in the dark behind them .
975 9
 (1, 3),
1,happiness,glad,But it 's nothing nothing really only im glad
2,null,null,rather
3,null,null,that you should share all our little troubles
4,null,null,because then youll know us better
5,null,null,wont you
6,null,null,Dear Maggie
7,null,null,there 's been something between us all this time
8,null,null,has n't there
9,null,null,Ever since our first meeting and it 's partly been my fault .
976 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,I wasnt good at first
2,null,null,I wanted to be kind
3,null,null,but I was stiff and shy
4,null,null,You would n't think that im shy
5,null,null,I am
6,null,null,terribly
7,null,null,I always have been since I was very little
8,sadness,embarrassed,and just to enter a room when other people are there makes me so embarrassed
9,null,null,I remember once when mother was alive her scolding me because I would n't come in to a tea party
10,null,null,But I could n't
11,null,null,I stood outside the door in an agony
12,null,null,doing everything to make myself go in but I could n't
977 12

1,null,null,im grown up now
2,null,null,i 've got my three hundred pounds and I dont think I want to be religious

5,null,null,im afraid
6,null,null,I know im very careless
7,null,null,I do want to be better
8,null,null,and that 's all the more reason
9,null,null,perhaps
10,null,null,why I should go out and earn my own living
11,null,null,i 'd learn more quickly then
12,null,null,But I do love you and Aunt Elizabeth
978 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Nevertheless there did come to her suddenly then a new tenderness for her aunt
2,sadness,pain,the actual sight of her pain in the Chapel had deeply touched her and now her eagerness for escape was mingled with a longing to be affectionate and good .
980 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,panic,In a panic at these thoughts
2,null,null,and feeling as though some one was trying to push her down into a coffin whilst she was still alive
3,null,null,she began hurriedly to speak
4,null,null,although she did not know whether her aunt were asleep or no .
981 10
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I would n't like to hurt your feelings
2,null,null,Aunt Anne
3,sadness,not happy,and it is n't that im not happy with you and Aunt Elizabeth
4,null,null,but I ought to be earning my own living

8,null,null,im not complaining

982 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,ashamed,Maggie felt ashamed of herself
2,null,null,What desperate silly feelings had she allowed last night
3,null,null,How much she had made of that service
4,null,null,and how weak she was to give way so easily
983 9
 (1, 2),
1,surprise,surprise,There to her surprise
2,null,null,she found Caroline Smith
3,null,null,The events of the last few days had
4,null,null,a little
5,null,null,dimmed Caroline from her memory
6,null,null,She had not seen Caroline for a fortnight
7,null,null,She did not know that she especially wanted to see Caroline now
8,null,null,However
9,null,null,it was very certain that Caroline wanted to see her .
985 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,I must just slip out of your path and youll forget me
2,happiness,happy,and then youll meet a much better man than I and be happy
3,null,null,im queer I have funny moods that last for days and days sometimes .
986 7
 (6, 3),(7, 3),
1,null,null,i 've never had any one I could love until you came
2,null,null,but now that you have come it cant be anything that you can do that can alter it
3,null,null,If you were to go away i 'd still love you
4,null,null,because it 's the love in me that matters
5,null,null,not what I get for it
6,sadness,unhappy,Perhaps youll make me unhappy
7,sadness,unhappy,but anyway one will be unhappy some of the time .
987 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Then when I saw how you trusted me
2,null,null,I thought i 'd be a cad and let it continue
3,null,null,but somehow
4,null,null,you 've got an influence over me
5,sadness,ashamed,you 've made me ashamed of things I would n't have hesitated about a year ago
6,null,null,And the funny thing is it is n't your looks
7,null,null,I can say things to you I could n't to other women
8,null,null,and i 'll tell you right away that there are lots of women attract me more .
989 12
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,"  I only said might
2,disgust,mind,mind you
3,null,null,"   said Thurston
4,null,null,smiling
5,null,null,"  It 's only a short-sighted fool would think that of you really
6,null,null,And im not a fool
7,null,null,really
8,null,null,im not
9,null,null,i 've got quite another idea of you
10,null,null,My idea is that you 're one of us whether you want to be or not
11,null,null,and that you always will be one of us
12,null,null,That 's why I like you and will be a friend to you too .  "
991 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When you 've been at this game a bit you scarcely know what you do believe
2,null,null,that 's the truth of it
3,null,null,There may be something in it after all
4,null,null,Sometimes
5,null,null,well
6,surprise,surprise,it ' ud surprise you if you 'd seen all the things I have
7,null,null,I dont mean ghosts and spirits and all that kind of nonsense .
992 3
 (1, 1),
1,anger,angry,His mind wandered . He looked about the little room and thought of Thurston . Why was he not more angry about it all
2,null,null,He had pretended to be indignant
3,null,null,he had hated Thurston as he stood there
993 11
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,And this figure
2,null,null,Martin knew
3,null,null,was a prey to every morbid desire
4,null,null,rushed to sensual excess and then crept back miserably to search for some spiritual flagellation
5,null,null,Above all
6,sadness,restless,it was restless
7,null,null,as some one presses round a dark room searching for the lock of the door
8,null,null,restless and lonely
9,null,null,cowardly and selfish
10,null,null,but searching and sensitive and even faithful
11,null,null,faithful to something or to some one
994 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Miss Pyncheon was the soul of good nature but she was much more than that
2,null,null,She was by far the most sensible
3,null,null,genial
4,null,null,and worldly of the Inside Saints
5,null,null,it was
6,null,null,in fact
7,surprise,astonishing,astonishing that she should be an Inside Saint at all .
995 14
 (3, 11),
1,null,null,Do you know that I love you more than anything in the whole world
2,null,null,More
3,fear,afraid,im sometimes terribly afraid
4,null,null,than God Himself
5,null,null,I cant help myself
6,null,null,I love you
7,null,null,Martin
8,null,null,so that it 's like hunger or thirst
9,null,null,It 's the only earthly passion that i 've ever had
10,null,null,And i 'll tell you another thing
11,null,null,It 's the one terror of my earthly life that youll leave me
12,null,null,Now that i 've got you back im afraid every time you go out of the house that youll run away
13,null,null,round the corner
14,null,null,and never come back again .
996 10
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,I cant help myself
2,null,null,I love you
3,null,null,Martin

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,helpless,When you remind me of what I was like as a kid I go right back and feel helpless as though you could do anything with me you like
2,null,null,All the same I dont believe in this business
3,null,null,father all this Second Coming and the rest of it .
999 7
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,nothing
3,null,null,"   said Maggie
4,null,null,slowly
5,null,null,Then she went on
6,null,null,laughing :   "  i 've been asked out to tea for the first time in my life
7,fear,frightened,And im terribly frightened .  "
1000 2
 (1, 2),
1,happiness,unexpected joy,This was unexpected joy to Caroline
2,null,null,who had never imagined that there would be any one so near the Inner Saints as Maggie who yet knew nothing about these recent events .
1001 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,"  Two visions
2,null,null,Just like the first
3,null,null,The blazing light and the voice and telling him that the last night of the year 's to be the time
4,happiness,excitement,Caroline then began to be carried away by her excitement
5,null,null,She talked faster and faster .
1002 7
 (5, 3),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,anyway
3,null,null,Miss Avies is the strongest of the lot really
4,null,null,i 'd back her against anybody
5,fear,terrified of her,im terrified of her myself
6,null,null,I tell you frankly
7,null,null,She 'd wring any one 's neck for twopence .
1003 8
 (7, 8),
1,null,null,"  Well
2,null,null,I know Martin Warlock 's going to ask me
3,null,null,It 's been getting closer and closer
4,null,null,I expect he will this week
5,null,null,Of course
6,null,null,he is n't so safe as William
7,happiness,exciting,but he 's much more exciting
8,null,null,And he 's got quite a lot of money of his own .  "
1004 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The boldness
2,happiness,excitement,the excitement of this inflamed her
3,null,null,It was so like her to challenge any action once she was in it by taking it to its furthest limit
4,null,null,She put it in an envelope and wrote Martin 's name with a flourish .
1005 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,After that abrupt opening there seemed to be nothing to say
2,null,null,Maggie 's thoughts also were elsewhere
3,happiness,passionately,She was wishing now passionately that she had not given that note to Caroline .
1006 4
 (2, 3),(4, 3),
1,null,null,Maggie told her about the visit
2,surprise,curiously,Aunt Anne looked at her curiously
3,null,null,She seemed so weak and frail that Maggie suddenly felt warm maternal love
4,surprise,shyly,Rather shyly she put her hand upon her aunt 's :   "  I wont go away until you 're better  "
1007 6
 (2, 3),(2, 5),
1,null,null,If Martin could love her it did not matter what others thought nevertheless she pulled her hat about a little and patted her dress
2,sadness,desperately lonely,The cab stopped and she felt desperately lonely
3,null,null,Did any one care about her anywhere
4,null,null,No
5,null,null,no one
6,null,null,She could have cried with pity at the thought of her own loneliness .
1008 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Some one came forward to her
2,null,null,some one so kind and comforting
3,null,null,so easy and unsurprised that Maggie suddenly felt herself steadied as though a friend had put an arm around her
4,null,null,Before she had felt :   "  This light I am shabby
5,null,null,Now she felt
6,null,null,"  I am with friendly people
7,surprise,surprised,She was surprised at the way that she was suddenly at her ease .
1009 9
 (4, 7),
1,null,null,"  No
2,null,null,"   answered Maggie
3,null,null,"  It is n't that exactly
4,sadness,not happy,im not happy at home
5,null,null,but I think that 's my fault
6,null,null,My aunts are very good
7,null,null,But I want to be free
8,null,null,It is all very religious where I am
9,null,null,and they want me to believe in their religion .
1010 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,It is all very religious where I am
2,null,null,and they want me to believe in their religion
3,fear,afraid,im afraid im not religious at all
4,null,null,Then I dont want to be dependent on people .
1012 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,It is that I seem to bring a curse on every one im fond of
2,null,null,I love my father
3,sadness,miserable,and i 've come back and made him miserable
4,null,null,It 's always like that
5,null,null,And if I made you miserable it would be the worst thing I ever did
1014 5
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,uncomfortable,Maggie had an uncomfortable feeling that her aunt had in some way mysteriously defeated her by this sudden abandonment of all protest
2,null,null,and for a moment the mysterious house closed around her
3,null,null,with its shadows and dim corners and the little tinkling Chapel hell in the heart of it
4,null,null,But the thought of Martin dissolved the shadows
5,null,null,and off she went .
1015 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,frightened,In some strange way she was frightened of the evening
2,null,null,although she had already pledged her word to him on something much more final :   "  No
3,null,null,"   she thought to herself
4,null,null,"  when the moment comes for me to leave everything
5,null,null,I will go
6,null,null,but he shall know that I am not doing it cheaply
7,null,null,simply for an evening 's fun .  "
1016 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But Maggie had no eloquence in reply she could not make up fine sentences
2,sadness,embarrassed,it embarrassed her dreadfully to tell him even that she loved him
3,null,null,and when he was sentimental it was her habit to turn it off with a joke if she could
4,null,null,She wanted terribly to ask him sometimes what he had meant when he said that he didnt love her as he had loved other women .
1017 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,He looked more wandering than ever with his high white collar
2,null,null,his large spectacles
3,null,null,and his thin
4,null,null,dusty hair
5,null,null,the fire of some hidden
6,null,null,vital spirit burnt beneath those glasses
7,sadness,ashamed,and his face was so kindly that she felt ashamed of herself for having avoided him so often .
1019 5
 (2, 2),(2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,He stopped and there was a long silence between them
2,sadness,silent,Maggie was silent because she never knew what to say when he burst into parables and divided mankind
3,null,null,under strange names
4,null,null,into different camps
5,null,null,And yet this time she did know a little what he was after .
1020 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,embarrassed,He cleared his throat as though he were embarrassed and were conscious that he had been making a fool of himself
2,null,null,Maggie felt that he was disappointed in her
3,null,null,She was sorry for that
4,null,null,but she was as she was .
1021 4

1,sadness,conscious,He cleared his throat as though he were embarrassed and were conscious that he had been making a fool of himself
2,null,null,Maggie felt that he was disappointed in her
3,null,null,She was sorry for that
4,null,null,but she was as she was .
1022 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Her face was white
2,null,null,with the effect of a chalk drawing into which live
3,null,null,black
4,null,null,burning eyes had been stuck
5,fear,frightened,But it was none of these things that frightened Maggie
6,null,null,It was the expression somewhere in the mouth
7,null,null,in the eyes
8,null,null,in the pale bony hands
9,null,null,that spoke of some meeting with a torturer whose powers were almost omniscient almost
10,null,null,but not quite .
1023 3
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,caution,When Aunt Anne moved now it was with infinite caution
2,null,null,as though she were stalking her enemy and was afraid lest any incautious gesture should betray her into his ambush
3,null,null,No less marked than her torture was her courage and the expectation that sustained that courage .
1025 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Also a magnificent lady
2,null,null,in furs so rich that you could see nothing of her but her powdered nose
3,null,null,was waving ropes of pearls about in a blase manner very close to them
4,null,null,and Maggie had a strange
5,fear,fear,entirely unreasonable fear that this splendour would suddenly turn round and snatch the little pearl ring and go off with it .
1026 6
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,Martin
2,null,null,although he would willingly have given her the most gorgeous ring in the shop
3,happiness,delighted,was delighted to find that her taste was so good
4,null,null,and like herself
5,null,null,He had great ideas about taste
6,null,null,some of his secret fears had been lest her strange uncouth upbringing should have caused her to like gaudy things .
1027 6
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  Just see whether it fits
2,null,null,darling
3,null,null,"   he said
4,sadness,despairing,At the word  "  darling "   the prophet cast another despairing look about the shop
5,null,null,as though he knew well the length of time that lovers could take over these things if they once put their hearts into it
6,null,null,Maggie was ashamed of her stubby finger as she put her hand forward but the ring fitted exactly .

 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Stupid the pleasure that his few words had given her
2,null,null,but she felt once again
3,null,null,as she had felt in Katherine Mark 's drawing-room
4,null,null,the contact with that other world

 (6, 5),
1,null,null,The Lyric Theatre was their destination
2,null,null,Maggie drew a breath as they stepped into the hall where there stood two large stout commissionaires in blue uniforms
3,null,null,gold buttons
4,null,null,and white gloves
5,null,null,People pushed past them and hurried down the stairs on either side as though a theatre were a Nothing
6,sadness,feeling lonely,Maggie stood there fingering her gloves and feeling lonely
7,null,null,The oil painting of a beautiful lady with a row of shining teeth faced her
8,null,null,There were also some palms and a hole in the wall with a man behind it .
1040 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,As he breathed she breathed too
2,null,null,and it seemed to her that their bodies rose and fell as one body
3,null,null,Without looking directly at him
4,null,null,which would
5,null,null,she knew
6,sadness,embarrass,embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her
7,null,null,she could out of the corner of her eye see the ruddy brown of his cheek and the hard thick curve of his shoulder .
1041 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But as the play continued she must listen
2,happiness,was thrilling to her,It was her very first play and soon it was thrilling to her so that she forgot
3,null,null,for a time
4,null,null,even Martin
5,null,null,Or rather Martin was mingled with it
6,null,null,absorbed in it
7,null,null,part of it
8,null,null,and she was there too sharing with him the very action of the story .
1042 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But meanwhile
2,null,null,of course
3,null,null,she saw a handsome young soldier who was young like herself
4,sadness,bored,and she was naturally bored with the studious gentleman
5,null,null,Maggie shared all the feelings of the Charity girl
6,null,null,Had she been brought up
7,null,null,say by a man like Mr
8,null,null,Trenchard and then had met Martin
9,null,null,why
10,null,null,of course
11,null,null,she could have gone only one way .
1043 10
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Tea came
2,null,null,but she could not eat anything . In some strange way that moment in the theatre when he had pressed her hand had altered everything . She recognised in herself a new Maggie
3,happiness,excited,she was excited with a thick burning excitement
4,null,null,she was almost sleepy with the strain of it and her cheeks were hot
5,null,null,but her throat icy cold . When she told him that she wasnt hungry
6,null,null,he said
7,null,null,"  im not either
8,null,null,Then he added
9,null,null,not looking at her
10,null,null,"  That fellow wont be back for an hour .  "
1044 12
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,null,null,She remembered his dark look
2,null,null,his frown when she had refused himOh
3,null,null,this loneliness
4,null,null,this helplessness
5,null,null,If she could be with him
6,null,null,beside him
7,happiness,fear nothing,she would fear nothing
8,null,null,That night
9,null,null,the first faint suspicion of jealousy
10,null,null,of doubt
11,null,null,an agonising dart of pain at the knowledge of what it would mean to her now if he left her
12,null,null,stirred in her breast . This room was stifling
1045 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Aunt Anne 's aloofness was coloured now with a very human anger
2,surprise,surprise,Maggie realised with surprise that she had never seen her angry before
3,null,null,She had been indignant
4,null,null,disapproving
5,null,null,superior
6,null,null,forbidding
7,null,null,but never angry .
1046 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,The mist of anger dimmed the room
2,null,null,it was in the potatoes and the cold dry mutton
3,null,null,especially was it in the hard pallid knobs of cheese
4,null,null,And Aunt Elizabeth
5,fear,frightened,although she was frightened by her sister 's anger on this occasion
6,null,null,shared in it
7,null,null,She pursed her lips at Maggie and moved her fat
8,null,null,podgy hand as though she would like to smack Maggie 's cheeks .
1047 3
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,were n't happy,I advised that strongly against my sister 's opinion because I thought you were n't happy
2,null,null,You didnt make friends amongst our friends

2,null,null,"   went on Aunt Anne
3,null,null,"  we would have forgiven that
4,null,null,It is your deceit to ourselves that we cannot forget
5,null,null,Day after day you were meeting him and pretending that you went to your other friends
6,sadness,disappointed,I am disappointed in you
7,null,null,bitterly disappointed
8,null,null,I saw from the first that you did not mean to care for us
9,null,null,now

1,null,null,Meanwhile
2,null,null,how they must all have been talking
3,happiness,felt no especial anger,She felt no especial anger against Caroline Smith
4,null,null,It had been her own fault for trusting that note to her honour
5,null,null,Caroline had no honour
6,null,null,of course
7,null,null,Maggie might have guessed that from the way that she talked about other people .
1050 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,She went up to her bedroom
2,null,null,and when she reached it she realised
3,fear,with a little pang of fright,with a little pang of fright
4,null,null,that she was a prisoner

 (6, 7),
1,null,null,She
2,null,null,knowing nothing of the world

2,null,null,He would like to have gone on and asked other questions
3,sadness,exhausted,but the old man seemed so worn out and exhausted that he was afraid of distressing him
4,null,null,so he just sat there

6,null,null,and suddenly the white head nodded
7,null,null,the beard sank over the breast and huddled up in the chair as though life itself had left him
8,null,null,the old man slept .

3,null,null,mysteriously
4,happiness,enjoyed,as though she enjoyed her share in the conspiracy
5,null,null,Maggie sped upstairs
6,null,null,and now with Martin 's words in her ears
7,null,null,had enough to stiffen her back for the battle .

5,null,null,other faces
6,null,null,again
7,null,null,like Amy Warlock 's
8,null,null,grimly set upon secret thoughts and purposes of their own
9,null,null,faces trained to withstand any sudden attack on the emotions
10,null,null,but eager
11,null,null,too
12,null,null,like the rest for some revelation that was to answer all questions and satisfy all expectations .
1061 19
 (15, 6),(15, 7),(15, 8),(15, 9),(15, 10),
1,null,null,Maggie wondered
2,null,null,as she looked about her
3,null,null,how she could have raised in her own imagination
4,null,null,around the Chapel and its affairs
5,null,null,so formidable an atmosphere of terror and tyrannic discipline
6,null,null,Here gathered together were a few women
7,null,null,tired
8,null,null,pale
9,null,null,many of them uneducated
10,null,null,awaiting like children the opening of a box
11,null,null,the springing into flower of a dry husk of a seed
12,null,null,the raising of the curtain on some wonderful scene
13,null,null,Maggie
14,null,null,as she looked at them
15,sadness,disappointed,knew that they must be disappointed
16,null,null,and her heart ached for them all
17,null,null,yes
18,null,null,even for Amy Warlock
19,null,null,her declared enemy .
1062 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,She only saw them all tired and hungry and expectant
2,null,null,perhaps
3,null,null,after all
4,null,null,there WAS something behind it all something for which they had a right to be searching
5,happiness,touched and moved,even of that she had not sure knowledge  but the pathos and also the bravery of their search touched and moved her
6,null,null,She was beginning to understand something of the beauty that hovered like a bird always just out of sight about the ugly walls of the Chapel .
1063 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Only Martin was flesh and blood
2,fear,feared,to be loved and longed for and feared for just as he had always been
3,null,null,All the physical properties of life clothes
4,null,null,food
5,null,null,household possessions
6,null,null,money became of less and less importance to him
7,null,null,Had Amy not watched over him he would have been many days without any food at all
8,null,null,and one day he come into the living-room at breakfast time clothed in a towel .
1064 9
 (3, 4),(3, 5),(3, 6),

2,null,null,"   she used to say to herself and feel his elder by at least twenty years
3,sadness,not a happy one,Nevertheless the thought of his struggling on there alone was not a happy one
4,null,null,She longed
5,null,null,even though she might not advise him
6,null,null,to comfort him
7,null,null,She was beginning to realise something of her own power over him and to see
8,null,null,too
9,null,null,the strange mixture of superstition and self reproach and self distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him .
1065 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Maggie thought
2,null,null,watching her aunt 's austere composure from the other side of the dining table
3,sadness,sad,She was sad at the thought of that
4,null,null,remembering moments that first visit to St
5,null,null,Dreot 's
6,null,null,the departure in the cab
7,null,null,the night when she had sat at her aunt 's bedside that had given glimpses of the kind human creature Aunt Anne might have been had she never heard of the Inside Saints .

2,null,null,It was excitement
3,null,null,not only because of the dim mysterious events that the evening promised
4,null,null,but also because she was sure that this day would settle the loneliness of herself and Martin .
1067 8
 (7, 1),(7, 2),(7, 3),
1,null,null,She had not been certain
2,null,null,all this time
3,null,null,whether the aunts meant to take her to the service with them
4,null,null,She had supposed that her introduction to the meeting at Miss Avies 's meant that they intended to include her in this too
5,null,null,but now
6,null,null,as the evening advanced
7,fear,terror,in a fit of nervous terror she prayed within herself that they would not take her
8,null,null,If the end of the world were coming she would like to meet it in her bed .
1068 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,"  It 's a quarter past eleven
2,null,null,It 's time to put on your things

2,null,null,Time stole on and it was now ten minutes to twelve .
1072 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,When she saw him she stood speechless where she was
2,fear,terrified,The change in him terrified her so that her heart seemed to leap into her throat choking her
3,null,null,The colour had drained from his face
4,null,null,leaving it dry and yellow
5,null,null,He had an amazing resemblance to his father
6,null,null,his eyes had exactly the same bewildered expression as though he were lost and yet he seemed quite calm
7,null,null,his only movement was one hand that wandered up and down his waistcoat feeling the buttons one after the other .

8,null,null,Bellows
9,null,null,who

1,null,null,Maggie rebuked herself for thinking this
2,null,null,but again and again the thought arose
3,null,null,Grace was in a state of perpetual wonder
4,surprise,amazed,everything amazed her
5,null,null,You would not think to look at her flat broad placidity that she was a creature of excitement
6,null,null,and it might be that her excitement was rather superficial
7,null,null,She would say :   "  Why
8,null,null,Just fancy

4,null,null,but that was because Martin had been involved

6,null,null,she hated to care whether people laughed at the way she came into a room or whether she expressed foolish opinions about books and pictures .

2,null,null,"  That 's not the way to get into heaven
3,null,null,"   he said
4,null,null,"  We must be more patient than that
5,null,null,The daily round

7,null,null,and Grace is awful
8,null,null,In the summer it 's all nigger minstrels and bathing tents

3,surprise,surprise,to his own surprise
4,null,null,when they were alone in the drawing-room
5,null,null,he kissed her

7,null,null,gently on the forehead .

4,null,null,I want to be somewhere where everything is quiet and orderly
5,null,null,and every one knows their own mind and all the bells ring at the right time and no one 's strange or queer
6,null,null,and most of all  where no one 's afraid of anything
7,happiness,afraid,All my life i 've been with people who were afraid and i 've been afraid myself
8,null,null,Now Paul and Grace are not afraid of anything .  "

1,null,null,She would have hated a church full of staring people
2,happiness,enjoyed,She enjoyed immensely buying her trousseau
3,null,null,Paul was very generous with his money
4,null,null,it was evident that Grace thought him too generous .
1099 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  Grace is n't my teacher
2,surprise,surprised,"   said Maggie with a sudden hot hostility that surprised herself .
1100 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Grace would be here in an hour
2,surprise,Strange,Strange how throughout all these last days Maggie had been looking forward to that event with dread
3,null,null,There was no definite reason for fear
4,null,null,in London Grace had been kindness itself and had shown real affection for Maggie .
1101 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,She 'll understand in time
2,null,null,As I was saying
3,anger,angry,I was so angry that I caught the old man by the arm and I said to him
4,null,null,' if you think you 're paid to lean up against a wall and not do your duty you 're mightily mistaken
5,null,null,and if you are n't careful i 'll report you that 's what i 'll do
6,null,null,' and he said what were his exact words
1102 12
 (4, 5),(12, 5),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,it is
3,null,null,"   said Maggie

5,null,null,I never knew it was your mother
6,null,null,It wasnt a very good painting I thought
7,null,null,so I took it down
8,null,null,If I had known
9,null,null,of course
10,null,null,I never would have touched it
11,null,null,Oh Grace
12,sadness,sorry,I AM so sorry .  "
1103 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,These things were not for her
2,null,null,and indeed did she allow her fancy to dwell
3,null,null,for a moment
4,fear,a panic,upon them she was besieged at once by so horrid a panic that she lost all control and self possession
5,null,null,She therefore very quickly put those things from her and thenceforth lived in the world as in a castle surrounded by a dark moat filled with horrible and slimy creatures who would raise a head at her did she so much as glance their way .
1104 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The moment she saw Maggie she was resolved
2,null,null,here was just the creature
3,null,null,a mouse of a girl
4,null,null,no parents
5,null,null,no money
6,null,null,no appearance
7,null,null,nothing to make her proud or above herself
8,null,null,some one to be moulded and trained in the way she should go
9,surprise,surprise,To her great surprise she discovered that Paul was at once attracted by Maggie :  had she ever wondered at anything she would have wondered at this
10,null,null,but she decided that it was because she herself had made the suggestion
11,null,null,Dear Paul
12,null,null,he was always so eager to fall in with any of her proposals .
1105 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Maggie
2,null,null,in fact
3,happiness,enjoyed,enjoyed herself during the weeks immediately following Grace 's return
4,null,null,Paul seemed tranquil and happy
5,null,null,there were no signs of fresh outbreaks of the strange passion that had so lately frightened her .

5,fear,frightened,there were no signs of fresh outbreaks of the strange passion that had so lately frightened her .
1107 7
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,And that other life began to be dim and faint even Martin was a little hidden and mysterious
2,happiness,glad,Strangely she was glad of that
3,null,null,the only way that this could be carried through was by keeping the other out of it
4,null,null,Would the two worlds mingle
5,null,null,Would the faces and voices of those spirits be seen and heard again
6,null,null,Would they leave Maggie now or plan to steal her back
7,null,null,The whole future of her life depended on the answer to that
1108 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She was bored with them all
2,null,null,the Choir practices
3,null,null,the Committees
4,null,null,the Altar flowers
5,null,null,and the rest
6,happiness,pleased,she was only too pleased that Maggie should do the hard work it was quite fair that she
7,null,null,Grace
8,null,null,should have a rest
9,null,null,At the same time she did not at all want to surrender the power that doing these things had given her .
1109 3
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,surprise,She then would  "  lose her temper "   so much to her own surprise that she at once decided that some one else must be responsible
2,null,null,A few days after her return she decided that she  "  must not let these things go
3,null,null,"   so she told Maggie that she would attend the Committee of Old Women 's Comforts and be responsible for the Choir practice .
1111 5
 (2, 3),(2, 4),(2, 5),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,disgust,impatiently,"   said Maggie impatiently
3,null,null,"  im not practical of course
4,null,null,I dont know what one should do
5,null,null,but I do know that no one should be shut up .  "
1113 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,"  I dont want to curse you
2,null,null,Caroline
3,null,null,"   said Maggie
4,null,null,"  Sit down
5,null,null,Tea will be here in a minute
6,sadness,unhappy,I was very unhappy about what you did
7,null,null,but that 's all a long time ago now
8,null,null,and I was to blame too .  "
1114 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,It may be said
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,in Grace 's defence that she gave Maggie every chance
4,surprise,marvelled,She marvelled at her own patience
5,null,null,For two years after that moment
6,null,null,when she decided that Maggie was  "  queer
7,null,null,"   and that her beloved Paul was in real danger of his losing his soul because of that  "  queerness
8,null,null,"   she held her hand
9,null,null,She was not naturally a patient woman she was not introspective enough to be that and she held no brief for Maggie
10,null,null,Nevertheless for two whole years she held her hand
1115 8
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,when in the dusk of that summer evening
3,null,null,she saw Paul kiss Maggie
4,null,null,as the moths blundered about her lamp
5,fear,terrified,her stolid unimaginative heart was terrified
6,null,null,This girl
7,null,null,who was she
8,null,null,What had she been before they found her
1116 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,You know he took the Collects in the wrong order last Sunday
2,null,null,and last night he read the wrong lesson
3,anger,angry,Two days ago he was quite angry with me because I suggested another tune for ' lead Kindly Light - unlike himself .
1117 10
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,His whole nature was easy
2,null,null,genial
3,null,null,and
4,null,null,above all
5,null,null,lazy
6,null,null,He liked to be liked
7,surprise,astonished,and she Was often astonished at the pleasure with which he received compliments
8,null,null,He had a conceit of himself
9,null,null,not as a man but as a clergyman
10,null,null,and she knew that nothing pleased him so much as when people praised his  "  good natured humanity .
1118 11
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,despair,It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune
2,null,null,which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country
3,null,null,Moreover
4,null,null,he had once more lost the Princess Badoura 's talisman
5,null,null,which he feared he might never see again
6,null,null,There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done
7,null,null,and to live on in the cottage
8,null,null,As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself
9,null,null,he engaged a lad to help him
10,null,null,and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars
11,null,null,filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport .
1119 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back
2,null,null,She waited for him till evening rather impatiently
3,null,null,and wondering what could have kept him from her so long
4,surprise,despair,When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly
5,null,null,In spite of her grief and anxiety however
6,null,null,she did not lose her presence of mind
7,null,null,but decided on a courageous
8,null,null,though very unusual step .
1120 9
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  My son
2,fear,fear,the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it
3,null,null,There are no olives in the Ebony Island
4,null,null,and those imported from here fetch a high price
5,null,null,As you know
6,null,null,I have a good stock of the olives which grew in this garden
7,null,null,Now you must take fifty jars
8,null,null,fill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives
9,null,null,We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark .  "
1121 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The prince took this advice
2,null,null,and spent the rest of the day filling the fifty jars
3,fear,fearing,and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip from his arm and be lost again
4,null,null,he took the precaution of putting it in one of the jars
5,null,null,on which he made a mark so as to be able to recognise it
6,null,null,When night came the jars were all ready
7,null,null,and the prince and his host went to bed .
1122 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  Sire
2,null,null,"   replied the prince
3,null,null,"  pray do not increase my distress in this matter
4,happiness,happy,but rather make me happy by giving her to me in marriage
5,null,null,However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly
6,null,null,the sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices
7,null,null,and I will gratefully receive her from your hands .  "
1123 4
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,surprised,The queen was much surprised by these words
2,null,null,but when she declared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess lost all respect
3,null,null,and answered that if she were not allowed to marry as she wished she should kill herself
4,null,null,and it was in vain that the queen tried to pacify her and bring her to reason .
1124 2
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,happy,The prince and princess were now entirely happy
2,null,null,and months slipped by unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other 's society .
1125 5
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,surprised,The light in the prince 's room surprised her
2,null,null,and without disturbing the slave
3,null,null,who slept across the threshold
4,null,null,she entered the room
5,null,null,and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied .
1126 22
 (22, 22),
1,null,null,"  The king
2,null,null,her father
3,null,null,has carefully shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze
4,null,null,and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband
5,null,null,But in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before
6,null,null,The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal
7,null,null,the second of bronze
8,null,null,the third of fine steel
9,null,null,the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze
10,null,null,the fifth of touchstone
11,null,null,the sixth of silver
12,null,null,and the seventh of solid gold
13,null,null,They are all most sumptuously furnished
14,null,null,whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste
15,null,null,In fact
16,null,null,neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess
17,null,null,The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide
18,null,null,and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage
19,null,null,The king has always received these embassies graciously
20,null,null,but says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will
21,null,null,and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal
22,sadness,disappointed,the envoys have had to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were gratified by their magnificent receptions .

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  My brother
2,surprise,surprised,be not surprised to see us
3,null,null,this is our land
4,null,null,and as we came to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating down it
5,null,null,and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore
6,null,null,We have waited for your awakening
7,null,null,tell us now whence you come and where you were going by that dangerous way
1130 18
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,happy,Rich and happy as I was after my third voyage
2,null,null,I could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether
3,null,null,My love of trading
4,null,null,and the pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange
5,null,null,made me set my affairs in order
6,null,null,and begin my journey through some of the Persian provinces
7,null,null,having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the different places I intended to visit
8,null,null,I took ship at a distant seaport
9,null,null,and for some time all went well
10,null,null,but at last
11,null,null,being caught in a violent hurricane
12,null,null,our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her
13,null,null,and many of our company perished in the waves
14,null,null,with a few others
15,null,null,had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck
16,null,null,for the storm had driven us near an island
17,null,null,and scrambling up beyond the reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted
18,null,null,to wait for morning .
1131 17
 (15, 14),
1,null,null,With that he supplied me with provisions
2,null,null,and bade me farewell
3,null,null,and I set out with my new companions
4,null,null,I soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts
5,null,null,but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks
6,null,null,I did not at all understand how we were to do it
7,null,null,The crowns of the cocoa palms were all alive with monkeys
8,null,null,big and little
9,null,null,which skipped from one to the other with surprising agility
10,null,null,seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance
11,null,null,and I was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures
12,null,null,which seemed to me quite harmless
13,null,null,But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily
14,null,null,for the monkeys
15,anger,annoyed,annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin
16,null,null,began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful gestures
17,null,null,so that after very little labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained .
1132 24
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and killed it
2,null,null,and handed me a knife
3,null,null,which they said I should by and by find useful
4,null,null,"  We must sew you into this sheep skin
5,null,null,"   said they
6,null,null,"  and then leave you
7,null,null,A fowl of monstrous size
8,null,null,called a roc
9,null,null,will appear in the air
10,null,null,taking you to be a sheep
11,null,null,He will snatch you up and carry you into the sky
12,null,null,but be not alarmed
13,null,null,for he will bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain
14,null,null,When you are on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throw it off
15,fear,fear,As soon as the roc sees you he will fly away from fear
16,null,null,but you must walk on till you come to a castle covered with plates of gold
17,null,null,studded with jewels
18,null,null,Enter boldly at the gate
19,null,null,which always stands open
20,null,null,but do not ask us to tell you what we saw or what befel us there
21,null,null,for that you will learn for yourself
22,null,null,This only we may say
23,null,null,that it cost us each our right eye
24,null,null,and has imposed upon us our nightly penance .  "

2,null,null,Just at this moment a servant came out of the palace
3,null,null,and taking him by the arm said
4,null,null,"  Come with me
5,null,null,the noble Sindbad
6,null,null,my master
7,null,null,wishes to speak to you .  "
1134 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,As will be imagined
2,surprise,surprise,these words took the Sultan by surprise
3,null,null,and he looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess
4,null,null,As I was unable to speak
5,null,null,I placed my hand on my head to show that it was true .
1135 7
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,grief,At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain
2,null,null,I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow
3,null,null,Then
4,null,null,fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father
5,null,null,I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase
6,null,null,and quitting the underground chamber
7,null,null,made everything fast as before .
1136 20
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The knock was answered by Sadie
2,null,null,with a taper in her hand

4,surprise,surprised,who was surprised at her beauty
5,null,null,bowed low before her
6,null,null,and said respectfully

8,null,null,we are three merchants who have lately arrived from Moussoul
9,null,null,and
10,null,null,owing to a misadventure which befel us this very night

12,null,null,Not knowing what to do
13,null,null,we wandered in the streets till we happened to pass your house
14,null,null,when
15,null,null,seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices
16,null,null,we resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the dawn
17,null,null,If you will grant us this favour
18,null,null,we will
19,null,null,with your permission
20,null,null,do all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly .  "

2,null,null,and wished to try your good nature
3,null,null,so I presented myself in the disguise you saw
4,null,null,Now I have rewarded you by saving your life

27,null,null,you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage
28,null,null,and you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water
29,null,null,That is all I have to say
30,null,null,You know what you have to do

9,null,null,She 's a fine woman
10,null,null,though
11,null,null,I think
12,null,null,good natured and good-hearted
13,null,null,He cautioned her not to overlook Aileen and Norah
14,null,null,because the Butlers
15,null,null,mother and father
16,happiness,very proud,were very proud of them .

1,null,null,Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood at this time was thirty-two years old
3,null,null,Cowperwood twenty-seven
4,null,null,The birth and care of two children had made some difference in her looks
5,null,null,She was no longer as softly pleasing
6,null,null,more angular
7,null,null,Her face was hollow cheeked
8,null,null,like so many of Rossetti 's and Burne-Jones 's women
9,null,null,Her health was really not as good as it had been the care of two children and a late undiagnosed tendency toward gastritis having reduced her
10,sadness,suffered from fits of depression,In short she was a little run down nervously and suffered from fits of depression
11,null,null,Cowperwood had noticed this
12,null,null,He tried to be gentle and considerate
13,null,null,but he was too much of a utilitarian and practical minded observer not to realize that he was likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later .
1234 9
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Sympathy and affection were great things
2,null,null,but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss
3,null,null,So often now he saw young girls who were quite in his mood
4,happiness,exceedingly robust,and who were exceedingly robust and joyous
5,null,null,It was fine
6,null,null,advisable
7,null,null,practical
8,null,null,to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon
9,null,null,but if you had a sickly wife .
1236 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,He was not at all sure
2,null,null,for instance
3,null,null,that the negroes could be made into anything much more significant than they were
4,null,null,At any rate
5,null,null,it was a long uphill struggle for them
6,null,null,of which many future generations would not witness the conclusion
7,null,null,He had no particular quarrel with the theory that they should be free
8,null,null,he saw no particular reason why the South should not protest vigorously against the destruction of their property and their system
9,disgust,too bad,It was too bad that the negroes as slaves should be abused in some instances
10,null,null,He felt sure that that ought to be adjusted in some way
11,null,null,but beyond that he could not see that there was any great ethical basis for the contentions of their sponsors .
1238 21

1,null,null,He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes
2,null,null,though he knew them to be trying to many

4,null,null,but
5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him
8,null,null,So he had gone his way day by day

1,null,null,Aileen always reminded Cowperwood of a high stepping horse without a check rein
2,null,null,He met her at various times
3,null,null,shopping with her mother
4,null,null,out driving with her father
5,null,null,and he was always interested and amused at the affected
6,null,null,bored tone she assumed before him the  "  Oh
7,null,null,dear
8,null,null,Oh
9,null,null,dear
10,null,null,Life is so tiresome

13,null,null,as a matter of fact
14,happiness,thrilling interest,every moment of it was of thrilling interest to her
15,null,null,Cowperwood took her mental measurement exactly
16,null,null,A girl with a high sense of life in her
17,null,null,romantic
18,null,null,full of the thought of love and its possibilities .

4,null,null,tamed somewhat by the doctrines and conventions of current society
5,null,null,still showed clear at times in an elemental and not entirely unattractive way
6,happiness,decidedly attractive,At this time she was only eighteen years of age decidedly attractive from the point of view of a man of Frank Cowperwood 's temperament
7,null,null,She supplied something he had not previously known or consciously craved
8,null,null,Vitality and vivacity .
1244 9
 (1, 1),
1,fear,gripped her,But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her
2,null,null,and when she sat at the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before her mirror
3,null,null,she was conscious of her figure
4,null,null,her charms
5,null,null,what they meant to men
6,null,null,how women envied her
7,null,null,Sometimes she looked at poor
8,null,null,hollow chested or homely faced girls and felt sorry for them
9,null,null,at other times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically .

5,happiness,pleasant sense,giving a pleasant sense of greenery from the street
6,null,null,and to place a few chairs there

1,null,null,There were then two famous American sculptors
2,null,null,Powers and Hosmer
3,null,null,of whose work he had examples
4,null,null,but Ellsworth told him that they were not the last word in sculpture and that he should look into the merits of the ancients

6,null,null,there were other streets
7,null,null,and the city was growing

9,null,null,One could afford to pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait and extend the lines into larger and better areas later
10,null,null,And already he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the  "  endless chain
11,null,null,"   or  "  agreeable formula
12,null,null,"   as it was later termed
13,null,null,of buying a certain property on a long-time payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient not only to pay your seller
14,null,null,but to reimburse you for your trouble
15,null,null,to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other things  allied properties
16,null,null,for instance
17,null,null,against which more bonds could be issued
18,null,null,and so on
19,null,null,ad infinitum
20,null,null,It became an old story later

22,null,null,and he kept the thought closely to himself
23,happiness,glad,None the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this

1,happiness,interested him greatly,There was one line being laid out to within a few blocks of his new home the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line it was called  which interested him greatly
2,null,null,He rode on it occasionally when he was delayed or did not wish to trouble about a vehicle
3,null,null,It ran through two thriving streets of red-brick houses
4,null,null,and was destined to have a great future once the city grew large enough

4,null,null,All they said was in its peculiar way true

6,null,null,She was running deep with ambition
7,null,null,and she was all the more conspicuous
8,anger,irritating,and in a way irritating to some
9,null,null,because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects
10,null,null,against which she was inwardly fighting

3,null,null,She stood before the latter
4,null,null,looking at her bare arms and shoulders

7,null,null,and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles
8,null,null,The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first
9,null,null,and she chided her maid
10,null,null,Kathleen Kelly
11,null,null,She studied how to arrange her hair
12,null,null,and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted
13,null,null,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,null,null,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,null,null,Finally
16,null,null,she found one size and one place that suited her
17,null,null,She turned her head from side to side
18,null,null,looking at the combined effect of her hair

4,null,null,and she had
5,null,null,with the permission of her mother and father
6,null,null,indulged herself to the full
7,null,null,She studied a golden-yellow silk
8,null,null,with cream lace shoulder straps
9,null,null,and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully
10,null,null,but set it aside .
1264 14

9,null,null,had been adopted by Aileen with enthusiasm

11,null,null,and thrust her chin and nose forward to make it set right

10,null,null,She was so young
11,null,null,She was beautiful

1,null,null,Cowperwood understood
2,null,null,He walked away
3,fear,nervous,He was quite warm and tense now almost nervous
4,null,null,It was quite clear to him that he had done or was contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing
5,null,null,Under the current code of society he had no right to do it
6,null,null,It was against the rules
7,null,null,as they were understood by everybody

9,null,null,for instance his father every one in this particular walk of life
10,null,null,However
11,null,null,much breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be

1,null,null,Still

3,null,null,strong thoughts of her were in his mind
4,null,null,And despite his involved social and financial position
5,null,null,which he now recalled
6,happiness,interesting,it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even calculatingly and worse
7,null,null,enthusiastically  he was pumping the bellows that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl
8,null,null,to feed a fire that might ultimately consume him and how deliberately and resourcefully

2,null,null,when based upon mutual sympathy and understanding between two

5,null,null,Life cannot be put into any mold

 (24, 17),(24, 18),
1,null,null,His one pet idea
2,null,null,the thing he put more faith in than anything else
3,null,null,was his street railway manipulations
4,null,null,and particularly his actual control of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line
5,null,null,Through an advance to him
6,null,null,on deposit
7,null,null,made in his bank by Stener at a time when the stock of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line was at a low ebb
8,null,null,he had managed to pick up fifty-one per cent
9,null,null,of the stock for himself and Stener
10,null,null,by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road
11,null,null,To accomplish this
12,null,null,however
13,null,null,he had resorted to some very  "  peculiar "   methods
14,null,null,as they afterward came to be termed in financial circles
15,null,null,to get this stock at his own valuation
16,null,null,Through agents he caused suits for damages to be brought against the company for non-payment of interest due
17,null,null,A little stock in the hands of a hireling
18,null,null,a request made to a court of record to examine the books of the company in order to determine whether a receivership were not advisable

1,happiness,intoxicated,This intoxicated him
2,null,null,for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long contemplated dream that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line
3,null,null,issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public
4,null,null,using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way
5,null,null,In short
6,null,null,he was one of those early
7,null,null,daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement .

5,null,null,Drexel & Co

2,null,null,And many hands up heaved the giant corpse
3,null,null,And swiftly bare him to the ships
4,null,null,and there Washed they away the blood that clotted lay dust flecked on mighty limbs and armour .

1,sadness,desperate,This track the Blest Gods may alone behold . So died a host on either side that warred Over Machaon and Aglaia 's son . But at the last through desperate wrestle of fight The Danaans rescued them :  yet few were they Which bare them to the ships .
1579 11

1653 6

1655 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,He spake
2,null,null,and vanished
3,null,null,mingling with the winds
4,null,null,But their hearts felt the God 's power :  suddenly Flooded with boundless courage were their frames
5,anger,Maddened,Maddened their spirits :  on the foe they leapt Like furious wasps that in a storm of rage Swoop upon bees
6,null,null,beholding them draw nigh In latter summer to the mellowing grapes
7,null,null,Or from their hives forth streaming thitherward .

1658 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But not very heartily
2,fear,feared,for I feared that his doing of it was only to ease himself of the salary which he gives me
3,null,null,Moore and I went to the French Ordinary
4,null,null,where Mr
5,null,null,Downing this day feasted Sir Arth .
1659 6
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Then came he in
2,null,null,and took a very civil leave of me
3,surprise,beyond my expectations,beyond my expectations
4,null,null,for I was afraid that he would have told me something of removing me from my office
5,null,null,but he did not
6,null,null,but that he would do me any service that lay in his power .
1660 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Great

6,null,null,But since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies More from briareus ' hands
7,null,null,than argus ' eyes
8,null,null,i 'll sing thy obsequies with trumpet sounds
9,null,null,And write thy epitaph with blood and wounds .
1661 7
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,ashamed,And how that he is quite ashamed of himself
2,null,null,and confesses how he had deserved this
3,null,null,for his baseness to his brother
4,null,null,And that he is like to pay part of the money
5,null,null,paid out of the Exchequer during the Committee of Safety
6,null,null,out of his own purse again
7,null,null,which I am glad on .
1662 4

1664 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,That many in the House do press for new oaths to be put upon men
2,sadness,be sorry,whereas we have more cause to be sorry for the many oaths that we have already taken and broken That the late petition of the fanatique people prevented by Barebone

 (5, 5),
1,null,null,The chief is that
2,null,null,that I had from Mr

4,null,null,viz
5,fear,fears,that he fears the Cavaliers in the House will be so high
6,null,null,that the other will be forced to leave the House and fall in with General Monk
7,null,null,and so offer things to the King so high on the Presbyterian account that he may refuse
8,null,null,and so they will endeavour some more mischief .

1677 7
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,In the afternoon my Lord and I walked together in the coach two hours

1720 9
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,I had hardly done reckoning them up when two or three bustling men came out and shepherded us all energetically into a long

9,null,null,engaged to go I knew not where
10,null,null,in some ship I did not know even the name of
11,null,null,in which I was to receive I did not know how much
12,null,null,or how little
13,null,null,for my labour
14,null,null,nor how long I was going to be away .
1723 9
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,For the first quarter of an hour
2,null,null,in spite of the September chill
3,null,null,the sweat poured off me in streams

6,null,null,it was sculling
7,null,null,the old bumboat was wobbling all around like a drunken tailor with two left legs
8,sadness,apprehension,I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass
9,null,null,I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way .
1724 6
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Such brutality I never witnessed before
2,null,null,On board of English ships ( except men-of-war ) there is practically no discipline

1725 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The third mate was nothing much but bad temper not much sailor

1726 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,It was a splendid picture
2,happiness,glad,but for the time I felt glad I was not on board of her
3,null,null,a very few minutes she was out of our ken
4,null,null,followed by the admiration of all .
1728 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,So we toiled watch and watch
2,null,null,six hours on and six off
3,null,null,the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty
4,null,null,and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great
5,null,null,there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil
6,null,null,Some of these were of enormous size
7,null,null,containing 350 gallons when full
8,fear,terrible,and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk .
1729 9
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,However
2,sadness,painfully,the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident
3,null,null,for we had a visit from the afterguard in force one afternoon
4,null,null,and Abner with his brewage was haled to the quarter deck
5,null,null,There
6,null,null,in the presence of all hands
7,null,null,he was arraigned
8,null,null,found guilty of stealing the ship 's stores
9,null,null,and sentence passed upon him .
1730 12
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,Suddenly one of the men
2,null,null,in lifting his net
3,null,null,slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat
4,null,null,jolting one of the oars

6,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
7,null,null,but now
8,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
9,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
10,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
11,null,null,having been absent only two hours
12,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1731 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
2,null,null,having been absent only two hours
3,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals
4,null,null,Not one of the crew had ever seen or heard of such fishing before
5,happiness,pride,so my pride and pleasure may he imagined
6,null,null,A little learning may be a dangerous thing at times
7,null,null,but it certainly is often handy to have about you .
1732 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1733 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There were men in that forecastle as good citizens and as brave fellows as you would wish to meet men who in their own sphere would have commanded and obtained respect
2,sadness,painful,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
3,null,null,Half starved and hopeless
4,null,null,their spirit had been so broken
5,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
6,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
7,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves .
1735 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Down comes the black watcher from above with a swoop like an eagle
2,null,null,Booby puts all she knows into her flight
3,null,null,but vainly
4,null,null,Escape is impossible
5,sadness,despairing,so with a despairing shriek she drops her load .
1736 5
 (1, 3),
1,happiness,happy,When we got on board we felt quite happy
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,for the first time since leaving America
4,null,null,we had a little singing
5,null,null,all I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey 's hymns
1738 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,null,null,t as for danger well
3,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
4,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1739 7
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done
2,sadness,pity,It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo
3,null,null,and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee
4,null,null,Next day
5,null,null,and for a whole week after
6,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
7,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner .  "
1740 1
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,astounding,For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding .
1742 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Thinking that such a sight ought not to be missed by the captain
2,null,null,I overcame my dread of him sufficiently to call him
3,null,null,and tell him of what was taking place
4,anger,anger,He met my remarks with such a furious burst of anger at my daring to disturb him for such a cause
5,null,null,that I fled precipitately on deck again
6,null,null,having the remainder of the vision to myself
7,null,null,for none of the others cared sufficiently for such things to lose five minutes sleep in witnessing them
8,null,null,The conflict ceased
9,null,null,the sea resumed its placid calm
10,null,null,and nothing remained to tell of the fight but a strong odour of fish
11,null,null,as of a bank of seaweed left by the tide in the blazing sun .
1743 8
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,the three hundred fathoms of line
2,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
3,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
4,happiness,Happily,Happily
5,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
6,null,null,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
7,null,null,Meanwhile
8,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1745 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,null,null,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,fear,feared,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant
6,null,null,Besides
7,null,null,it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship
8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1746 12
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,The chief was looking astern at some finbacks
2,null,null,the look-out men forward were both staring to leeward
3,null,null,thus for a minute or so I had a small arc of the horizon to myself
4,null,null,The time was short
5,null,null,but it sufficed
6,null,null,and for the first time that voyage I had the privilege of  "  raising "   a sperm whale
7,happiness,excitement,My voice quivered with excitement as I uttered the war whoop
8,null,null,"  Ah blo o o o w
9,null,null,"   Round spun the mate on his heel
10,null,null,while the hands clustered like bees roused from their hive
11,null,null,"  Where away where
12,null,null,"   gasped the mate .
1747 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,The ship kept near
2,null,null,and Mr
3,null,null,Count
4,null,null,seeing how matters were going
5,null,null,had hastily patched his boat
6,null,null,returning at once with another tub of line
7,null,null,He was but just in time to bend on
8,happiness,delight,when to our great delight we saw the end slip from our rival 's boat
9,null,null,This in no wise terminated his lien on the whale
10,null,null,supposing he could prove that he struck first
11,null,null,but it got him out of the way for the time .
1749 15
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,You WANT somethin' to growl about
2,null,null,you do
3,null,null,"   Well
4,null,null,Cap'n George
5,null,null,"   said one of the men
6,null,null,"  you shorely dont think we k'n eat shells
7,null,null,do yer
8,null,null,"   Just then I caught sight of the kid 's contents
9,anger,indignation,and could hardly restrain my indignation
10,null,null,For in a dirty heap
11,null,null,the sight of which might have pleased an Esquimaux
12,null,null,but was certainly enough to disgust any civilized man
13,null,null,lay the calipee
14,null,null,or under shell of the turtle
15,null,null,hacked into irregular blocks .
1750 9
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,But he gradually returned to his old self
2,happiness,relief,to my great relief
3,null,null,and I ventured somewhat timidly to remind him of the esteem in which he was held by all hands
4,null,null,even the skipper
5,null,null,I ventured to say
6,null,null,respected him
7,null,null,although
8,null,null,from some detestable form of ill humour
9,null,null,he had chosen to be so sneering and insulting towards him .
1753 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I felt sure
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
4,null,null,In fact
5,fear,afraid,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
6,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
7,null,null,We hauled steadily away
8,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
9,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1754 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
2,null,null,for never a spout did we see
3,happiness,delight,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
4,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time
5,null,null,Determined to have a big catch
6,null,null,if possible
7,null,null,we lowered all five boats
8,null,null,as it was a beautifully calm day
9,null,null,and the ship might almost safely have been left to look after herself .
1755 8
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,But then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related
7,null,null,When the highly dangerous nature of the work is remembered
8,null,null,this statement may seem somewhat overdrawn
1756 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed downward with such terrific force that
2,null,null,striking his head on the bottom
3,null,null,he had broken his neck
4,sadness,grieved,I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance of securing him
5,null,null,but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him
6,null,null,all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us
7,null,null,So with such patience as we could command we waited near the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to emerge once more into the blessed light of day .
1757 6
 (3, 3),(3, 4),(3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,Let it be so
2,null,null,For my part
3,happiness,rejoice,I rejoice that I have no tale of weeks of drunkenness
4,null,null,of brutal rape
5,null,null,treacherous murder
6,null,null,and almost unthinkable torture to tell .
1758 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprised,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,null,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style
5,null,null,With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
6,null,null,most men prefer the boarding-house
7,null,null,where
8,null,null,if they preserve the same commercial status which is a SINE QUA NON at the  "  home
9,null,null,"   they are treated like gentlemen
1759 10
 (8, 6),
1,null,null,While the final touch was being given to our task i
2,null,null,the hole boring through the tail fin all hands lay around in various picturesque attitudes
3,null,null,enjoying a refreshing smoke
4,null,null,care forgetting
5,null,null,While thus pleasantly employed
6,null,null,sudden death
7,null,null,like a bolt from the blue
8,sadness,terrible,leapt into our midst in a terrible form
9,null,null,The skipper was labouring hard at his task of cutting the hole for the tow line
10,null,null,when without warning the great fin swung back as if suddenly released from tremendous tension .
1760 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A ruined house
2,null,null,surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead
3,null,null,stood in the middle of this piece of land
4,surprise,curious,Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be
5,null,null,I asked the mate if he knew anything of it
6,null,null,He told me that an American named Halstead
7,null,null,with his family
8,null,null,lived here for years
9,null,null,visited only by an occasional whaler
10,null,null,to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time .
1761 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
2,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
3,null,null,To my mind
4,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
5,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1762 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Shall we take scorn instead of glory
2,surprise,marvel,The Briton will marvel that he was conquered by men whom he sees fear is enough to conquer
3,null,null,We struck them before with panic
4,null,null,shall we be panic-stricken by them
5,null,null,We scorned them when before us
1763 9
 (6, 9),
1,null,null,Nothing of advantage to our cargo was seen for a long time
2,null,null,which
3,null,null,although apparently what was to be expected
4,null,null,did not improve Captain Slocum 's temper
5,null,null,But
6,surprise,surprise,to the surprise of all
7,null,null,when we had arrived off the beautiful island of Hong Kong
8,null,null,to which we approached closely
9,null,null,we  "  raised "   a grand sperm whale .
1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,null,null,and the three hundred fathoms of line
3,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
4,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
5,happiness,Happily,Happily
6,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
7,null,null,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
8,null,null,Meanwhile
9,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1766 10
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,True
2,null,null,the man was but a unit of no special note among us
3,null,null,but death had conferred upon him a brevet rank
4,null,null,in virtue of which be dominated every thought
5,surprise,strange,It seemed strange to me that we who faced death so often and variously
6,null,null,until natural fear had become deadened by custom
7,null,null,should
8,null,null,now that one of our number lay a rapidly corrupting husk before us
9,null,null,be so tremendously impressed by the simple
10,null,null,inevitable fact .
1767 18
 (11, 12),
1,null,null,None of your high art here
2,null,null,but haul in hand over hand
3,null,null,the line being strong enough to land a 250 pound fish
4,null,null,Up he came
5,null,null,the beauty
6,null,null,all silver and scarlet and blue
7,null,null,five feet long if an inch
8,null,null,and weighing 35 pounds
9,null,null,Well
10,null,null,such a lot of astonished men I never saw
11,surprise,hardly believe their eyes,They could hardly believe their eyes
12,null,null,That such a daring innovation should be successful was hardly to be believed
13,null,null,even with the vigorous evidence before them
14,null,null,Even grim Captain Slocum came to look and turned upon me as I thought a less lowering brow than usual
15,null,null,while Mr
16,null,null,Count
17,null,null,the mate
18,null,null,fairly chuckled again at the thought of how the little Britisher had wiped the eyes of these veteran fishermen .
1768 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,How did a whale act
2,null,null,what were the first steps taken
3,null,null,what chance was there of being saved if your boat got smashed
4,null,null,and so on unto infinity
5,null,null,At last
6,disgust,tired,getting very tired of this  "  Portuguese Parliament "   of all talkers and no listeners
7,null,null,I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in
8,null,null,The harpooner s and other petty officers were grouped in the waist
9,null,null,earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales .
1769 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,I said as cheerfully as I could
2,null,null,"  All right
3,null,null,sir
4,null,null,"   trying to look unconcerned
5,null,null,telling myself not to be a coward
6,null,null,and all sorts of things
7,fear,scared,but the cold truth is that I was scared almost to death because I didnt know what was coming  .  However
8,null,null,I did the best thing under the circumstances
9,null,null,obeyed orders and looked steadily astern
10,null,null,or up into the bronzed impassive face of my chief
11,null,null,who towered above me
12,null,null,scanning with eagle eyes the sea ahead .
1770 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He raised a gigantic tail on high
2,null,null,threshing the water with deafening blows
3,null,null,rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth
4,anger,agony,I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes
5,null,null,for Mr
6,null,null,Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger
7,null,null,although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan
8,null,null,In the agitated condition of the sea
9,null,null,it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to un ship the tall mast
10,null,null,which was of course the first thing to be done .
1771 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,So we toiled watch and watch
2,null,null,six hours on and six off
3,null,null,the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty
4,null,null,and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great
5,fear,dangerous,there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business
6,null,null,That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil
7,null,null,Some of these were of enormous size
8,null,null,containing 350 gallons when full
9,null,null,and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk .
1773 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
2,null,null,but now
3,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
5,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
6,null,null,having been absent only two hours
7,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1775 7
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,He made a fearful to-do over it
2,null,null,rolling completely over several times backward and forward
3,null,null,at the same time smiting the sea with his mighty tail
4,null,null,making an almost deafening noise and pother
5,happiness,comfortable,But we were comfortable enough
6,null,null,while we un shipped the mast and made ready for action
7,null,null,being sufficiently far away from him to escape the full effect of his gambols .
1777 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Anyhow
2,null,null,I could haul this piece alongside now
3,null,null,if I liked
4,null,null,and see
5,surprise,wondering,Secretly wondering at the indifference shown by this officer of forty years whaling experience to such a wonderful fact as appeared to be here presented
6,null,null,I thanked him
7,null,null,and
8,null,null,sticking the boat hook into the lump
9,null,null,drew it alongside .
1778 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,At seven bells ( 7
2,null,null,) it was  "  turn to "   all hands again
3,null,null,The  "  junk  "   was hooked on to both cutting tackles
4,null,null,and the windlass manned by everybody who could get hold
5,null,null,Slowly the enormous mass rose
6,null,null,canting the ship heavily as it came
7,disgust,complained,while every stick and rope aloft complained of the great strain upon them
8,null,null,When at last it was safely shipped
9,null,null,and the tackles cast off
10,null,null,the size of this small portion of a full-grown cachalot 's body could be realized
11,null,null,not before .
1779 13
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Here
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,we were better off than in an ordinary merchantman
4,disgust,mad,where doldrums are enough to drive you mad
5,null,null,The one object being to get along
6,null,null,it is incessant  "  pully hauly
7,null,null,"   setting and taking in sail
8,null,null,in order
9,null,null,on the one hand
10,null,null,to lose no time
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,on the other
13,null,null,to lose no sails .
1780 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1781 5
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,cheers,With hearty cheers from the whole population
2,null,null,we shoved off and ploughed through the kelp seaweed again
3,null,null,When we got clear of it
4,null,null,we found the swell heavier than when we had come
5,null,null,and a rough journey back to the ship was the result .
1782 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,afraid,The men were afraid to go on to the sick list
2,null,null,Nothing short of total inability to continue would have prevented them from working
3,null,null,such was the terror with which that man had inspired us all
4,null,null,It may be said that we were a pack of cowards
5,null,null,who
6,null,null,without the courage to demand better treatment
7,null,null,deserved all we got .
1783 8
 (3, 1),(3, 2),
1,null,null,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
2,null,null,half starved and hopeless
3,sadness,broken,their spirit had been so broken
4,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
5,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
6,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves
7,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
8,null,null,as I have before noted
1784 6
 (3, 3),(3, 6),
1,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
2,null,null,as I have before noted
3,disgust,resented,but I was perfectly well aware that the slightest attempt on my part to show that I resented our common treatment would meet with the most brutal repression
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,in addition
6,null,null,I might look for a dreadful time of it for the rest of the voyage .
1786 12
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,fairly good,The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good
2,null,null,although subject to electric storms of the most terrible aspect
3,null,null,but perfectly harmless
4,null,null,On the second evening after rounding Cape St
5,null,null,Mary
6,null,null,we were proceeding
7,null,null,as usual
8,null,null,under very scanty sail
9,null,null,rather enjoying the mild
10,null,null,balmy air
11,null,null,scent laden
12,null,null,from Madagascar .
1787 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good

1788 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,There was no thunder
2,null,null,but a low hissing and a crackling which did not amount to noise
3,null,null,although distinctly audible to all
4,sadness,unpleasant,Sensations most unpleasant of pricking and general irritation were felt by every one
5,null,null,according to their degree of susceptibility .
1789 13
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle
8,surprise,surprised,which they had surprised during his morning 's nap
9,null,null,One of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat 's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,diving deep
12,null,null,came up underneath him
13,null,null,seizing with crossed hands the two hind flippers .
1790 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,With the exception of the numerous native dhows that crept lazily about
2,null,null,we saw no vessels as we gradually drew out of the Mozambique Channel and stood away towards the Line
3,fear,dreaded,The part of the Indian Ocean in which we now found ourselves is much dreaded by merchantmen
4,null,null,who give it a wide berth on account of the numerous banks
5,null,null,islets
6,null,null,and dangerous currents with which it abounds .
1791 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Doubtless because he himself was much fatigued
2,null,null,the mate allowed him to run at his will
3,null,null,without for the time attempting to haul any closer to him
4,happiness,grateful,and very grateful the short rest was to us
5,null,null,But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water
6,null,null,coming up BEHIND us to rush off again in the opposite direction at undiminished speed .
1792 10
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Up till now we had not succeeded in getting home a single lance
2,null,null,the foe was becoming warier
3,null,null,while the strain was certainly telling upon our nerves
4,null,null,So Mr
5,null,null,Count got out his bomb gun
6,null,null,shouting at the same time to Mr
7,null,null,Cruce to do the same
8,sadness,hated,They both hated these weapons
9,null,null,nor ever used them if they could help it
10,null,null,but what was to be done
1793 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,We got the whale cut in as usual without any incident worth mentioning
2,surprise,curiosity,except that the peculiar shape of the jaw made it an object of great curiosity to all of us who were new to the whale fishing
3,null,null,Such malformations are not very rare
4,null,null,They are generally thought to occur when the animal is young
5,null,null,and its bones soft
1794 13
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,As soon as they had got far enough away from their native element
2,null,null,we rushed upon them
3,null,null,and captured them both
4,null,null,so that when the boat arrived we were not empty-handed
5,null,null,We had also a  "  jumper
6,null,null,"   or blouse
7,null,null,full of eggs
8,null,null,and a couple of immense bunches of cocoa nuts
9,happiness,happy,When we got on board we felt quite happy
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,for the first time since leaving America
12,null,null,we had a little singing
13,null,null,Shall I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey 's hymns
1795 11
 (7, 7),(7, 8),
1,null,null,It was but a school of kogia
2,null,null,or  "  short headed "   cachalots
3,null,null,but as we secured five of them
4,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
5,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
6,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
7,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
8,null,null,they were so lively
9,null,null,but as for danger well
10,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
11,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1796 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,null,null,Early on the second day of warning they had been hoisted to the topmost notch of the cranes
3,null,null,and secured as thoroughly as experience could suggest
1798 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In two minutes we were speeding away towards her
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,making a sweep round her stern
4,null,null,prepared to board her
5,disgust,awful,But we were met by a stench so awful that Mr
6,null,null,Count would not proceed
7,null,null,and at once returned to the ship
8,null,null,The boat was quickly hoisted again
9,null,null,and the ship manoeuvred to pass close to windward of the derelict .
1801 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Next day
2,null,null,and for a whole week after
3,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
4,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner "
5,surprise,amazing,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
1802 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
2,surprise,astounding,For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding
3,null,null,Very few sailors have noticed the sickening condition of the ocean when the life-giving breeze totally fails for any length of time
4,null,null,or
5,null,null,if they have
6,null,null,they have said but little about it .
1803 14
 (9, 9),(9, 10),
1,null,null,A light breeze then sprang up
2,null,null,aided by which we crept around Achin Head
3,null,null,the northern point of the great island of Sumatra
4,null,null,Like some gigantic beacon
5,null,null,the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene
6,null,null,Pulo Way
7,null,null,or Water Island
8,null,null,looked very inviting
9,happiness,glad,and I should have been glad to visit a place so well known to seamen by sight
10,null,null,but so little known by actual touching at
11,null,null,Our recent stay at the Cocos
12,null,null,however
13,null,null,had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative
14,null,null,unless we might be compelled by accident
1804 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Therefore
2,sadness,rough,we had all a rough time of it while his angry fit lasted
3,null,null,which was a whole week
4,null,null,or until all was shipshape again
5,null,null,Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo
6,null,null,never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business .
1805 13
 (10, 1),(10, 2),(10, 3),(10, 4),
1,null,null,The sorely wounded monster
2,null,null,with one tremendous expiration
3,null,null,rolled over and over swift as thought towards his aggressor
4,null,null,literally burying the boat beneath his vast bulk
5,null,null,Now
6,null,null,one would have thought surely
7,null,null,upon seeing this
8,null,null,that none of that boat 's crew would ever have been seen again
9,null,null,Nevertheless
10,surprise,strange,strange as it may appear
11,null,null,out of that seething lather of foam
12,null,null,all six heads emerged again in an instant
13,null,null,but on the OTHER side of the great creature .
1806 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The truth of Mr
2,null,null,Count 's forecast was verified to the hilt
3,null,null,for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about
4,null,null,the body that he was unable to move
5,null,null,while one of the hands
6,null,null,a Portuguese
7,null,null,was injured internally
8,null,null,and seemed very bad indeed
9,sadness,sorry,Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones
10,null,null,we should have scoffed at the notion
11,null,null,and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart .
1807 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,fear,anxious,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,null,null,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant .
1808 8

4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,fear,feared,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant
6,null,null,Besides
7,null,null,it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship
8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1809 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,They were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed
2,null,null,My democratic sentiments are deeply seated
3,null,null,but I do believe in authority
4,null,null,and respect for it being rigidly enforced
5,fear,upset,so this uncalled for scene upset me
6,null,null,making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson
7,null,null,They got one .
1810 7
 (6, 6),

1811 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,As I bent to my oar
2,sadness,sorry,I felt very sorry for what had happened
3,null,null,Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer
4,null,null,which
5,null,null,according to the severe code under which we lived
6,null,null,merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted
7,null,null,and lasting for the rest of the voyage .
1812 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,This sort of thing was right in his line
2,null,null,Naturally cruel
3,happiness,enjoy,he seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself in the prospect of making human beings twist and writhe in pain
4,null,null,Nor would he be baulked of a jot of his pleasure .
1814 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Meanwhile another ship was working up from to leeward
2,null,null,having evidently noted our movements
3,null,null,or else
4,null,null,like the albatross
5,null,null,"  smelt whale
6,null,null,"   no great distance to windward of him
7,happiness,exciting,Waiting for that whale to rise was one of the most exciting experiences we had gone through as yet
8,null,null,with two other ships so near
9,null,null,Everybody 's nerves seemed strung up to concert pitch
10,null,null,and it was quite a relief when from half a dozen throats at once burst the cry
11,null,null,"  There she white waters
12,null,null,Ah blo o o o w
1815 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Not seeing what had happened to his iron
2,null,null,or knowing that we were fast
3,null,null,the other harpooner promptly hurled his second iron
4,null,null,which struck solidly
5,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle
6,fear,bad,but our position was rather bad
7,null,null,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear
8,null,null,we were struggling frantically to get our sail down
9,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .
1816 5
 (3, 2),(3, 3),
1,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle
2,null,null,but our position was rather bad
3,anger,rage,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear
4,null,null,we were struggling frantically to get our sail down
5,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .
1817 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Our chief
2,null,null,foaming at the mouth with rage and excitement
3,null,null,was screeching inarticulate blasphemy at the other mate
4,null,null,who
5,null,null,not knowing what was the matter
6,null,null,was yelling back all his copious vocabulary of abuse
7,happiness,glad,I felt very glad the whale was between us
8,null,null,or there would surely have been murder done
9,null,null,At last
10,null,null,out drops the iron
11,null,null,leaving a jagged hole you could put your arm through
12,null,null,wasnt Mr
13,null,null,Count mad
1818 6
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,wasnt Mr
2,null,null,Count mad
3,anger,rage,I really thought he would split with rage
4,null,null,for it was impossible for us to go on with that hole in our bilge
5,null,null,The second mate came alongside and took our line as the whale was just commencing to sound
6,null,null,thus setting us free .
1819 14
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,And still the whale kept going steadily down
2,null,null,down
3,null,null,down
4,null,null,Already he was on the second boat 's lines
5,null,null,and taking them out faster than ever
6,null,null,Had we been alone
7,null,null,this persistence on his part
8,disgust,annoying,though annoying
9,null,null,would not have mattered much
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,with so many others in company
12,null,null,the possibilities of complication
13,null,null,should we need to slip our end
14,null,null,were numerous .
1820 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In this optimistic mood
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,I gaily flung myself into my place in the mate 's boat one morning
4,null,null,as we were departing in chase of a magnificent cachalot that had been raised just after breakfast
5,happiness,satisfaction,There were no other vessels in sight much to our satisfaction  the wind was light
6,null,null,with a cloudless sky
7,null,null,and the whale was dead to leeward of us
8,null,null,We sped along at a good rate towards our prospective victim
9,null,null,who was
10,null,null,in his leisurely enjoyment of life
11,null,null,calmly lolling on the surface
12,null,null,occasionally lifting his enormous tail out of water and letting it fall flat upon the surface with a boom audible for miles .
1821 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When I recovered
2,null,null,I was snug in my bunk aboard
3,null,null,but aching in every joint
4,null,null,and as sore as if I had been pounded with a club until I was bruised all over
5,null,null,During the day Mr
6,happiness,kind,Count was kind enough to pay me a visit
7,null,null,With his usual luck
8,null,null,he had escaped without the slightest injury
1822 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,annoyed,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders .
1823 7
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,When I told Samuela
2,null,null,of his chance
3,null,null,he was beside himself with joy
4,fear,scared,As to his being scared
5,null,null,the idea was manifestly absurd
6,null,null,He was as pleased with the prospect as it was possible for a man to be
7,null,null,and hardly able to contain himself for impatience to be off .
1824 10
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,happiness,joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,null,null,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .
1825 10
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters

5,surprise,surprise,It was a considerable surprise

8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .
1826 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It was a considerable surprise
2,null,null,but we were all ready
3,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
4,null,null,three boats were fast
5,null,null,only myself keeping out
6,null,null,in accordance with my instructions
7,disgust,distraught,Samuela was almost distraught with rage and grief at the condition of things
8,null,null,I quite pitied him
9,null,null,although I was anything but pleased myself .
1827 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thenceforward for another hour
2,null,null,in spite of all our efforts
3,null,null,we could not get within striking distance
4,null,null,mainly because of the close attention of the cow
5,null,null,which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother
6,disgust,impatient,I was getting so impatient of this hindrance
7,null,null,that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow
8,null,null,though I felt convinced that
9,null,null,if I did
10,null,null,I should spoil a good job .
1828 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We took them on board
2,null,null,and the boat returned again
3,null,null,By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern sheets
4,null,null,I felt sure
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
7,null,null,in fact
8,fear,afraid,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
9,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
10,null,null,We hauled steadily away
11,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
12,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1829 9
 (8, 8),(8, 9),
1,null,null,The ceaseless motion of the vessel rocking at the centre of a circular space of blue
2,null,null,with a perfectly symmetrical dome of azure enclosing her above
3,null,null,un flecked by a single cloud
4,null,null,becomes at last almost unbearable from its changeless sameness of environment
5,null,null,Were it not for the trivial round and common task of everyday ship duty
6,null,null,some of the crew must become idiotic
7,null,null,or
8,anger,rage,in sheer rage at the want of interest in their lives
9,null,null,commit mutiny .
1831 6
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,but then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related .
1832 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,for his first move was to come straight for me with a furious rush
2,null,null,carrying the war into the enemy 's country with a vengeance It must be remembered that I was but young
3,null,null,and a comparatively new hand at this sort of thing
4,fear,scared,so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent
5,null,null,I hope I shall be excused  .  Remembering
6,null,null,however
7,null,null,that all our lives depended on keeping cool
8,null,null,I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces
9,null,null,but compel myself to think and act calmly
10,null,null,since I was responsible for others If the animal had not been in so blind a fury
11,null,null,I am afraid my task would have been much harder
1833 13
 (9, 9),

8,null,null,If the animal had not been in so blind a fury
9,fear,afraid,I am afraid my task would have been much harder
10,null,null,but he was mad
11,null,null,and his savage rushes were
12,null,null,though disquieting
13,null,null,unsystematic and clumsy .
1834 12
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,When I returned to a consciousness of external things
2,null,null,I was for some time perfectly still
3,null,null,looking at the sky
4,null,null,totally unable to realize what had happened or where I was
5,null,null,Presently the smiling
6,null,null,pleasant face of Samuel bent over me
7,null,null,Meeting my gratified look of recognition
8,happiness,delight,he set up a perfect yell of delight
9,null,null,"  So glad
10,null,null,so glad you blonga life
11,null,null,No go Davy Jonesy dis time
12,null,null,hay
1835 4
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,I put my hand out to help myself to a sitting posture
2,null,null,and touched blubber
3,fear,startled,That startled me so that I sprung up as if shot
4,null,null,Then I took in the situation at a glance .
1836 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Samuela and Polly set to work with their sheath knives
2,null,null,and soon excavated a space in the blubber to enable them to reach the meat
3,null,null,Then they cut off some good-sized junks
4,null,null,and divided it up
5,null,null,It was not half bad
6,null,null,and as we chewed on the tough black fibre
7,happiness,smiling,I could hardly help smiling as I thought how queer a Christmas dinner we were having
8,null,null,But eating soon heightened our thirst
9,null,null,and our real sufferings then began .
1837 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The captain shook hands with me cordially
2,null,null,pooh poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade
3,happiness,delight,but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe
4,null,null,The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats
5,null,null,though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him
6,null,null,that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once
7,null,null,working all night .
1839 9
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,For unto us a Child is born
2,null,null,unto us a Son is given "   again and again billows and billows of glory
3,null,null,I gasped for breath
4,null,null,shook like one in an ague fit
5,null,null,the tears ran down in a continuous stream
6,surprise,amazed,while people stared amazed at me
7,null,null,thinking
8,null,null,I suppose
9,null,null,that I was another drunken sailor .
1840 6
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,disgust,disgust,I have no doubt whatever that some of the gentry who swear at large about the evils of missionaries would have been loud in their disgust at the entire absence of drink and debauchery
2,null,null,and the prevalence of what they would doubtless characterize as adjective hypocrisy on the part of the natives
3,null,null,but no decent man could help rejoicing at the peace
4,null,null,the security
5,null,null,and friendliness manifested on every hand
6,null,null,nor help awarding unstinted praise to whoever had been the means of bringing about so desirable a state of things .
1841 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animal ism as we witnessed at Honolulu
2,happiness,pleased,What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship
3,null,null,All the worship
4,null,null,all the management of affairs
5,null,null,was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves
6,null,null,and excellently well did they manage everything .
1842 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,What a sigh
2,null,null,One looked at the other inquiring ly
3,happiness,satisfied,but the repetition of that long expiration satisfied us all that it was the placid breathing of the whale we sought somewhere close at hand
4,null,null,The light grew rapidly better
5,null,null,and we strained our eyes in every direction to discover the whereabouts of our friend
6,null,null,but
7,null,null,for some minutes without result .
1843 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,News of our coming had preceded us
2,null,null,and the whole native population appeared to be afloat to make us welcome
3,null,null,The air rang again with their shouts of rejoicing
4,happiness,gorgeous feast,for our catch represented to them a gorgeous feast
5,null,null,such as they had not indulged in for many a day
6,null,null,The flesh of the humpbacked whale is not at all bad
7,null,null,being but little inferior to that of the porpoise
1844 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,That being settled
2,null,null,we anchored the boat
3,null,null,and lit pipes
4,null,null,preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances
5,disgust,troubling,the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf
6,null,null,Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light
7,null,null,shed in the wake of no ordinary sized fish
8,null,null,probably an immense shark .
1845 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But we lost no time in getting back to the ship
2,null,null,where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into
3,null,null,The captain
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,was very kind
6,happiness,pleasure,expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again
7,null,null,although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future
8,null,null,A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure
9,null,null,so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again .
1847 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Taking stock of him quietly during our day-long leisurely cruises in the boat
2,null,null,I often wondered whether his mind still kept its gloomy forebodings
3,null,null,and brooded over his tragical life-history
4,null,null,I never dared to speak to him on the subject
5,fear,fear,for fear of arousing what I hoped was growing too faint for remembrance
6,null,null,But at times I saw him in the moonlit evenings sitting on the rail alone
7,null,null,steadfastly gazing down into the star besprent waters beneath him
8,null,null,as if coveting their unruffled peace .
1848 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,A corn cob cigarette closed the banquet
2,null,null,After expressing my thanks
3,sadness,uneasiness,I noticed that the pain of his leg was giving my friend considerable uneasiness
4,null,null,which he was stolidly enduring upon my account rather than appear discourteous ly anxious to get rid of me .
1849 11
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,islands
2,null,null,air
3,null,null,and sea all shimmering in an enchanted haze
4,null,null,and silence scarcely broken by the tender ripple of the gently parted waters before the boat 's steady keel though these joys have all been lost to me
5,null,null,and I in  "  populous city pent "   endure the fading years
6,null,null,I would not barter the memory of them for more than I can say
7,happiness,sweet,so sweet it is to me
8,null,null,And
9,null,null,then
10,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable
11,null,null,so free from anything to regret .
1850 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,And
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable
4,null,null,so free from anything to regret
5,happiness,smile,Perhaps this simple statement will raise a cynical smile upon the lips of those who know Tahati
6,null,null,the New Hebrides
7,null,null,and kindred spots with all their savage
8,null,null,bestial orgies of alternate unbridled lust and unnamable cruelty .
1852 5
 (3, 3),(3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprised,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,null,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
5,null,null,most men prefer the boarding-house .
1853 4
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,startling,Its effect upon him was startling and immediate
2,null,null,He rushed off at so furious a rate dead to windward that for a great while we had all our work cut out to keep her free by baling
3,null,null,The sea had risen a little
4,null,null,and as we leapt from one wave to another the spray flew over us in an almost continuous cloud .
1854 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Before we left finally for New Zealand
2,null,null,every one of those Kanakas was as much at home in the whale boats as he would have been in a canoe
3,null,null,Of course they were greatly helped by their entire familiarity with the water
4,fear,dread,which took from them all that dread of being drowned which hampers the white  "  greenie "   so sorely
5,null,null,besides which
6,null,null,the absolute confidence they had in our prowess amongst the whales freed them from any fear on that head .
1855 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A ruined house
2,null,null,surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead
3,null,null,stood in the middle of this piece of land
4,surprise,curious,Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be
5,null,null,I asked the mate if he knew anything of it
6,null,null,He told me that an American named Halstead
7,null,null,with his family
8,null,null,lived here for years
9,null,null,visited only by an occasional whaler
10,null,null,to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time .
1856 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Rushing out of their house
2,null,null,they saw the heavens bespread with an awful pall of smoke
3,null,null,the underside of which was glowing with the reflected fires of some vast furnace
4,fear,terror,Their terror was increased by a smart shower of falling ashes and the reverberations of subterranean thunders
5,null,null,At first they thought of flight in their boat
6,null,null,not reckoning the wide stretch of sea which rolled between them and the nearest land
7,null,null,but the height and frequency of the breakers then prevailing made that impossible .
1859 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Our Kanakas
2,null,null,too
3,null,null,were overjoyed to find compatriots among the visitors
4,null,null,and settled down to a steady stream of talk which lasted
5,null,null,without intermission
6,null,null,the whole night through
7,null,null,It was a wonderful exhibition of tongue wagging
8,disgust,puzzled,though what it was all about puzzled me greatly .
1860 11
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,Every Londoner knows how strongly that beautiful scent appeals to him
2,null,null,even when wafted from draggled branches borne slumwards by tramping urchins who have been far afield despoiling the trees of their lovely blossoms
3,null,null,careless of the damage they have been doing
4,null,null,But to me
5,null,null,who had not seen a bit for years
6,null,null,the flood of feeling undammed by that odorous breath
7,fear,overwhelming,was overwhelming
8,null,null,I could hardly tear myself away from the spot
9,null,null,and
10,null,null,when at last I did
11,null,null,found myself continually turning to try and catch another whiff of one of the most beautiful scents in the world .
1861 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Making myself at home with him
2,null,null,I desired to know what brought him so far from the  "  big smoke
3,null,null,"   and on board a whaler of all places in the world
4,null,null,He told me he had been a Pickford 's van driver
5,null,null,but had emigrated to New Zealand
6,disgust,did not at all like,finding that he did not at all like himself in the new country
7,null,null,Trying to pick and choose instead of manfully choosing a pick and shovel for a beginning
8,null,null,he got hard up .
1863 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,No one could gainsay that they had good reason
2,null,null,but I really feared for a time that we should have  "  ructions
3,null,null,"   As Paddy said
4,anger,angry,it was not wise or dignified for those officers to be so angry with him on account of his success
5,null,null,which he frankly owned was due almost entirely to the local knowledge he possessed
6,null,null,gained in many years study of the immediate neighbourhood
7,null,null,He declared that
8,null,null,as far as the technical duties of whale fishing went
9,null,null,all the Americans could beat him hollow
1864 9
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,His crew
2,null,null,on the impulse of the moment
3,null,null,sprang to the rail and cheered with might and main
4,null,null,No one could gainsay that they had good reason
5,fear,feared,but I really feared for a time that we should have  "  ructions
6,null,null,"   As Paddy said
7,null,null,it was not wise or dignified for those officers to be so angry with him on account of his success
8,null,null,which he frankly owned was due almost entirely to the local knowledge he possessed
9,null,null,gained in many years study of the immediate neighbourhood .
1865 10
 (7, 5),
1,null,null,At the close of our operations the welcome news was made public that four more fish like the present one would fill us bung up
2,null,null,and that we should then
3,null,null,after a brief visit to the Bluff
4,null,null,start direct for home
5,null,null,This announcement
6,null,null,though expected for some time past
7,surprise,amazing,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
8,null,null,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
9,null,null,where stern
10,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule .
1866 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This announcement
2,null,null,though expected for some time past
3,null,null,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
4,surprise,strange,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
5,null,null,where stern
6,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule
7,null,null,The captain
8,null,null,well pleased with the eagerness manifested
9,null,null,had his boat manned for a trip to the entrance of the harbour
10,null,null,to see what the weather was like outside
11,null,null,since it was not possible to judge from where the ship lay .
1867 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Satisfied that our days in the southern hemisphere were numbered
2,null,null,and all anxiety to point her head for home
3,happiness,pleasing,this news was most pleasing
4,null,null,putting all of us in the best of humours
5,null,null,and provoking quite an entertainment of song and dance until nearly four bells .
1869 15
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,however
2,null,null,showed no sign of doing so
3,null,null,although they all neared
4,null,null,with an accelerated drift
5,null,null,that point from whence no seamanship could deliver them
6,null,null,and where death inevitable
7,null,null,cruel
8,null,null,awaited them without hope of escape
9,fear,dangerous,The part of the coast upon which they were apparently driving was about as dangerous and impracticable as any in the world
10,null,null,A gigantic barrier of black
11,null,null,naked rock
12,null,null,extending for several hundred yards
13,null,null,rose sheer from the sea beneath
14,null,null,like the side of an ironclad
15,null,null,up to a height of seven or eight hundred feet .
1870 11
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,For the next four days and nights
2,null,null,during which the wind prevented the CHANCE from leaving us
3,null,null,our old ship was a scene of wild revelry
4,null,null,that ceased not through the twenty-four hours  revelry entirely unassisted by strong waters
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,the natural ebullient gaiety of men who were free from anxiety on any account whatever
7,null,null,rejoicing over the glad consummation of more than two years toil
8,null,null,on the one hand
9,null,null,on the other
10,happiness,joy,a splendid sympathy in joy manifested by the satisfied crew under the genial command of Captain Gilroy
11,null,null,With their cheerful help we made wonderful progress
1871 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,dirtier
2,null,null,gloomier
3,null,null,and colder grew the weather
4,null,null,until
5,null,null,reduced to two topsails and a reefed foresail
6,null,null,we were scudding dead before the gale for all we were worth
7,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
8,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
9,null,null,To my mind
10,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
11,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1872 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,You are running before the wind and waves
2,null,null,sometimes deep in the valley between two liquid mountains
3,null,null,sometimes high on the rolling ridge of one
4,fear,anxiously,You watch anxiously the speed of the sea
5,null,null,trying to decide whether it or you are going the faster
6,null,null,when suddenly there seems to be a hush
7,null,null,almost a lull
8,null,null,in the uproar
9,null,null,You look astern
10,null,null,and see a wall of water rising majestically higher and higher
11,null,null,at the same time drawing nearer and nearer .
1874 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,"  Ah
2,null,null,I am glad of it
3,null,null,Brougham will be so pleased  and yet it shocked you
4,null,null,Mr
5,null,null,Horn and you really think the poor lady minded it
6,null,null,Dear me
7,happiness,pleased,How pleased she will be when I tell her the impression it all made upon you
8,null,null,She 's worked so hard over the part and has been so nervous about it .
1875 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I left her only a moment ago she and her husband wanted me to take supper with them at Riley 's the new restaurant on University Place
2,null,null,you know
3,null,null,famous for its devilled crabs
4,happiness,like,But I always like to come here for my clams
5,null,null,Allow me a moment  "   and he bent over the steaming tub
6,null,null,and skewering the contents of a pair of shells with his iron fork held it out toward Oliver .
1877 10
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,"  Father 's all right
2,null,null,Sue
3,null,null,He 's always right
4,null,null,"   Oliver answered
5,null,null,"  He believes in Mr
6,null,null,Crocker
7,null,null,just as he believes in a lot of things that a good many people around here dont understand
8,null,null,He believes the time will come when they will value his pictures
9,happiness,proud,and be proud to own them

5,null,null,Just think of what a man can do with a few tubes of color
6,null,null,a brush
7,null,null,and a bit of canvas
8,null,null,So I dont care if they never buy what I paint .
1879 21
 (20, 19),

18,null,null,Why
19,null,null,when he does a good thing he 's nothing but a boy
20,happiness,glad,he 's so glad about it
21,null,null,I always know how his work has gone when I see his face .  "
1880 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,not only on his own account but on hers and his father 's
2,null,null,In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose
3,fear,fearing,fearing to wound his pride
4,null,null,she had put it solely on the ground of his settling down to some work .
1881 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Frode was thus forced to quit the wars of the East and fought a great battle in Sweden with his sister Swanhwid
2,null,null,in which he was beaten
3,null,null,So he got on board a skiff
4,null,null,and sailed stealthily in a circuit
5,null,null,seeking some way of boring through the enemy 's fleet
6,surprise,surprised,When surprised by his sister and asked why he was rowing silently and following divers meandering courses
7,null,null,he cut short her inquiry by a similar question
1882 12
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,When he had done these things
2,null,null,and gone back to his own land
3,null,null,one Skat entertained him at a banquet
4,null,null,desirous to mingle his toilsome warfare with joyous licence
5,null,null,Frode was lying in his house
6,null,null,in royal fashion
7,null,null,upon cushions of cloth of gold
8,null,null,and a certain Hunding challenged him to fight
9,null,null,Then
10,null,null,though he had bent his mind to the joys of wassail
11,happiness,delight,he had more delight in the prospect of a fray than in the presence of a feast
12,null,null,and wound up the supper with a duel and the duel with a triumph .
1885 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,If thou refuse thy daughter
2,happiness,pleased,consent to fight :  thou must needs grant one thing or the other We wish either to die or to have our prayers beard Something   sorrow if not joy   we will get from thee Frode will be better pleased to hear of our slaughter than of our repulse
3,null,null,Without another word
4,null,null,he threatened to aim a blow at the king 's throat with his sword The king replied that it was unseemly for the royal majesty to meet an inferior in rank in level combat
5,null,null,and unfit that those of unequal station should fight as equals .
1886 11
 (9, 9),(11, 9),
1,null,null,They found that Ragnar was dead
2,null,null,and that Kraka had already married one Brak
3,null,null,Then they remembered the father 's treasure
4,null,null,dug up the money
5,null,null,and bore it off
6,null,null,But Erik 's fame had gone before him
7,null,null,and Gotar had learnt all his good fortune
8,null,null,Now when Gotar learnt that he had come himself

1889 17
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,null,null,They were Goliath and the skipper
2,null,null,Captain Slocum 's right hand went naturally to his hip pocket
3,null,null,where he always carried a revolver
4,null,null,but before he could draw it
5,null,null,the long
6,null,null,black arms of his adversary wrapped around him
7,sadness,helpless,making him helpless as a babe
8,null,null,Then
9,null,null,with a rush that sent every one flying out of his way
10,null,null,Goliath hurled himself at the bulwarks
11,null,null,which were low
12,null,null,the top of the rail about thirty-three inches from the deck
13,null,null,The two bodies struck the rail with a heavy thud
14,null,null,instantly toppling overboard
15,null,null,That broke the spell that bound everybody
16,null,null,so that there was an instantaneous rush to the side
17,null,null,Only a hardly noticeable ripple remained on the surface of the placid sea .
1890 21
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Next he attacked and killed Hather in Jutland
2,null,null,and his fall is marked by the lasting name of the town
3,null,null,After this he overthrew Hunding and Rorik
4,null,null,seized Leire
5,null,null,and reunited the dismembered realm of Denmark into its original shape
6,null,null,Then he found that Asmund
7,null,null,the King of the Wikars
8,null,null,had been deprived of his throne by his elder sister
9,null,null,and
10,anger,angered,angered by such presumption on the part of a woman
11,null,null,went to Norway with a single ship
12,null,null,while the war was still undecided
13,null,null,to help him
14,null,null,The battle began
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,clothed in a purple cloak
17,null,null,with a coif broidered with gold
18,null,null,and with his hair bound up
19,null,null,he went against the enemy trusting not in arms
20,null,null,but in his silent certainty of his luck
21,null,null,in so much that he seemed dressed more for a feast than a fray .
1891 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Then Thorkill
2,null,null,seeing that they were of two minds
3,null,null,dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement
4,null,null,counselling them
5,null,null,to restrain themselves
6,null,null,and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter
7,happiness,delightful,albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold
8,null,null,to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear
9,null,null,neither to desire what was pleasant to take
10,null,null,nor dread what was awful to look upon
11,null,null,though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things .
1892 5
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Ragnar showed on this occasion the most merciful moderation towards the slayer of his dearest son
2,happiness,satisfied,since he sufficiently satisfied the vengeance which he desired
3,null,null,by the exile of the culprit rather than his death
4,null,null,This compassion shamed the Russians out of any further age against such a king
5,null,null,who could not be driven even by the most grievous wrongs to inflict death upon his prisoners .
1894 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness
2,null,null,and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house
3,sadness,sorrow,But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar
4,null,null,who had been expelled from the kingdom
5,null,null,For the Gauls had made him fly
6,null,null,and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella
7,null,null,the son of Hame .

 (8, 7),
1,null,null,We spent ten happy days in Honolulu
2,null,null,marred only by one or two drunken rows among the chaps forward
3,null,null,which
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
6,null,null,where good order was now kept
7,null,null,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
8,happiness,glad,which I was glad to see
9,null,null,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago

2,null,null,she never knew how sore that boy 's feet had been
3,null,null,nor how many times he had gone with half a meal or none at all
4,fear,fear,for fear of depleting too much the small store she had given him when he left home .
1897 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,to prevent any more troublesome business delaying his hopes of marriage
3,happiness,enjoyed,he went back to Gewar and enjoyed the coveted embraces of Nanna
4,null,null,Next
5,null,null,having treated Helgi and Thora very generously
6,null,null,he brought his new queen back to Sweden
7,null,null,being as much honoured by all for his victory as Balder was laughed at for his flight .
1898 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,But Odin
2,null,null,who had found that nothing served the wishes of lovers more than tough persistency
3,disgust,shame,though he was stung with the shame of his double rebuff
4,null,null,nevertheless
5,null,null,effacing the form he had worn before
6,null,null,went to the king for the third time
7,null,null,professing the most complete skill in soldier ship .
1899 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,So he besought them to make his son RORIK king

1,null,null,He had several times taken caravans to Karague
2,null,null,and knew all the languages well
3,sadness,unfortunately,but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied
4,null,null,That
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,I could not foresee
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,trusting to him and good-luck
9,null,null,I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters
10,null,null,but they came and went in the most tantalising manner
11,null,null,notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give .
1902 15
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,This night one was shot
2,null,null,without any mistake about it
3,null,null,for the next morning we tracked him by his blood
4,null,null,and afterwards heard he had died of his wound
5,null,null,The Wasui elders
6,null,null,contrary to my expectation
7,null,null,then came and congratulated us on our success
8,happiness,wonderful,They thought us most wonderful men
9,null,null,and possessed of supernatural powers
10,null,null,for the thief in question was a magician
11,null,null,who until now was thought to be invulnerable
12,null,null,Indeed
13,null,null,they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people
14,null,null,but though they had so many more guns than ourselves
15,null,null,they never succeeded in killing one .
1903 10
 (3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side

3,surprise,surprise,to surprise me
4,null,null,the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us
5,null,null,They had gone out of the lake at its northern end
6,null,null,paddled into
7,null,null,and then up the Kagera to where we stood
8,null,null,showing
9,null,null,by actual navigation
10,null,null,the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon .
1904 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu ( men eaters )
2,null,null,who disdained all food but human flesh
3,null,null,and Rumanika confirmed the statement
4,disgust,sceptical,Though I felt very sceptical  about it
5,null,null,I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick 's Nyam Nyams ( men eaters ) .
1905 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .

5,null,null,whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity
6,null,null,The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters
7,null,null,He tried to trust to his father 's promise
8,fear,terror,but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm

1,null,null,As I drew nearer and nearer to the light
2,null,null,the chasm became wider
3,null,null,and at last I saw
4,surprise,amaze,to my unspeakable amaze
5,null,null,a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss and illumined as far as the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas lamps placed at regular intervals
6,null,null,as in the thoroughfare of a great city
7,null,null,and I heard confusedly at a distance a hum as of human voices .
1928 13

5,null,null,He was not as bad as painted in the book
6,null,null,though he was dissolute and accounted dangerous
7,null,null,and when one night he died in reality
8,fear,so terrific,there came a thunderstorm so terrific that Sam Clemens at home
9,null,null,in bed
10,null,null,was certain that Satan had come in person for the half-breed 's soul

3,null,null,who no sooner saw it than he jumped and woh wohed with intense excitement at the treasure he had gained

6,null,null,however
7,null,null,proving impertinent
8,null,null,got a book flung at their heads
9,null,null,and a warning to be off
10,null,null,as I intended to see the king myself
11,null,null,and ask for food to keep my ever complaining Wanguana quiet
12,null,null,Proceeding to the palace
13,null,null,as I found Mtesa had gone out shooting
14,null,null,I called on the Kamraviona
15,null,null,complained that my camp was starving
16,null,null,and as I had nothing left to give the king said I wished to leave the country .

2,null,null,in flashes like high notes of sound
3,happiness,joy,with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were  "  worth "   than  most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side  of the pane
4,null,null,Stransom lingered long enough to suspend
5,null,null,in a  vision
6,null,null,a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim

3,surprise,surprise,To his surprise
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,after a  while
6,null,null,they did show him something :   the arch of a high doorway  approached by a low terrace of steps
7,null,null,in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end .

4,happiness,joy,This was a joy to Stransom
5,null,null,because it had hitherto been equally impossible for him either to  offer her presents or contentedly to stay his hand

1,null,null,Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice
2,null,null,as she went hunting about
3,null,null,and called out to her in an angry tone
4,null,null,Why
5,null,null,Mary Ann
6,null,null,what ARE you doing out here
7,null,null,Run home this moment
8,null,null,and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
9,null,null,Quick
10,null,null,now
11,null,null,' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to
12,null,null,without trying to explain the mistake it had made He took me for his housemaid
13,surprise,surprised,' she said to herself as she ran How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am
14,null,null,But i 'd better take him his fan and gloves that is
15,null,null,if I can find them
16,null,null,As she said this
17,null,null,she came upon a neat little house
18,null,null,on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  WRABBIT engraved upon it . She went in without knocking
19,null,null,and hurried upstairs
20,null,null,in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann

8,fear,fear,in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
9,null,null,and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves  How queer it seems
10,null,null,' Alice said to herself
11,null,null,to be going messages for a rabbit
12,null,null,I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next
13,null,null,' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen :    "  Miss Alice
14,null,null,Come here directly
15,null,null,and get ready for your walk
16,null,null,"    "  Coming in a minute
17,null,null,nurse
18,null,null,But i 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out
19,null,null,Only I dont think
20,null,null,' Alice went on
21,null,null,that they 'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people
2051 34
 (19, 18),
1,null,null,Alas
2,null,null,it was too late to wish that
3,null,null,She went on growing
4,null,null,and growing
5,null,null,and very soon had to kneel down on the floor :  in another minute there was not even room for this
6,null,null,and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door
7,null,null,and the other arm curled round her head . Still she went on growing
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,as a last resource
10,null,null,she put one arm out of the window
11,null,null,and one foot up the chimney
12,null,null,and said to herself  Now I can do no more
13,null,null,whatever happens What WILL become of me
14,null,null,' Luckily for Alice
15,null,null,the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
16,null,null,and she grew no larger :  still it was very uncomfortable
17,null,null,and
18,null,null,as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again
19,sadness,unhappy,no wonder she felt unhappy  It was much more pleasant at home
20,null,null,' thought poor Alice
21,null,null,when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller
22,null,null,and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I had not gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet it 's rather curious
23,null,null,you know
24,null,null,this sort of life
25,null,null,I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
26,null,null,When I used to read fairy-tales
27,null,null,I fancied that kind of thing never happened
28,null,null,and now here I am in the middle of one
29,null,null,There ought to be a book written about me
30,null,null,that there ought
31,null,null,And when I grow up
32,null,null,i 'll write one but im grown-up now
33,null,null,' she added in a sorrowful tone
34,null,null,at least there 's no room to grow up any more HERE . '
2052 16
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,A barrow full of WHAT
2,null,null,' thought Alice
3,null,null,but she had not long to doubt
4,null,null,for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window
5,null,null,and some of them hit her in the face i 'll put a stop to this
6,null,null,' she said to herself
7,null,null,and shouted out
8,null,null,you 'd better not do that again
9,null,null,' which produced another dead silence
10,surprise,with some surprise,Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor
11,null,null,and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes
12,null,null,' she thought
13,null,null,it 's sure to make SOME change in my size
14,null,null,and as it cant possibly make me larger
15,null,null,it must make me smaller
16,null,null,I suppose . '
2054 24
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,perhaps you have n't found it so yet
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day
5,null,null,you know and then after that into a butterfly
6,null,null,I should think youll feel it a little queer
7,null,null,wont you
8,null,null,' Not a bit
9,null,null,' said the Caterpillar Well
10,null,null,perhaps your feelings may be different
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,all I know is
13,null,null,it would feel very queer to ME
14,null,null,You
15,null,null,' said the Caterpillar contemptuously Who are YOU
16,null,null,' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
17,anger,felt a little irritated,ice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such VERY short remarks
18,null,null,and she drew herself up and said
19,null,null,very gravely
20,null,null,I think
21,null,null,you ought to tell me who YOU are
22,null,null,first
23,null,null,Why
24,null,null,' said the Caterpillar .
2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,null,null,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,null,null,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,null,null,and as it was perfectly round
4,null,null,she found this a very difficult question  .  However
5,null,null,at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
6,null,null,and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
7,null,null,nd now which is which
8,null,null,' she said to herself
9,null,null,and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect :  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin :  it had struck her foot
10,fear,a good deal frightened,She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
11,null,null,but she felt that there was no time to be lost
12,null,null,as she was shrinking rapidly
13,null,null,so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot
14,null,null,that there was hardly room to open her mouth
15,null,null,but she did it at last
16,null,null,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come
17,null,null,my head 's free at last
18,null,null,' said Alice in a tone of delight
19,null,null,which changed into alarm in another moment
20,null,null,when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found :  all she could see
21,null,null,when she looked down
22,null,null,was an immense length of neck
23,null,null,which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
2057 37
 (24, 23),
1,null,null,Let me alone
2,null,null,'  Serpent
3,null,null,I say again
4,null,null,' repeated the Pigeon
5,null,null,but in a more subdued tone
6,null,null,and added with a kind of sob
7,null,null,i 've tried every way
8,null,null,and nothing seems to suit them
9,null,null,'  I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about
10,null,null,' said Alice
11,null,null,'ve tried the roots of trees
12,null,null,and i 've tried banks
13,null,null,and i 've tried hedges
14,null,null,' the Pigeon went on
15,null,null,without attending to her
16,null,null,but those serpents
17,null,null,There 's no pleasing them
18,null,null,' Alice was more and more puzzled
19,null,null,but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs
20,null,null,' said the Pigeon
21,null,null,but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day
22,null,null,Why
23,null,null,I have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
24,disgust,annoyed,' im very sorry you 've been annoyed
25,null,null,' said Alice
26,null,null,who was beginning to see its meaning And just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood
27,null,null,' continued the Pigeon
28,null,null,raising its voice to a shriek
29,null,null,and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last
30,null,null,they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
31,null,null,Ugh
32,null,null,Serpent
33,null,null,'  But im NOT a serpent
34,null,null,I tell you
35,null,null,' said Alice im a im a '  Well
36,null,null,WHAT are you
37,null,null,' said the Pigeon
2058 20
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,While she was trying to fix on one
2,null,null,the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire
3,null,null,and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby  the fire irons came first
4,null,null,then followed a shower of saucepans
5,null,null,plates
6,null,null,and dishes  .  The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her
7,null,null,and the baby was howling so much already
8,null,null,that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
9,null,null,PLEASE mind what you 're doing
10,null,null,' cried Alice
11,null,null,jumping up and down in an agony of terror Oh
12,null,null,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
13,null,null,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
14,null,null,and very nearly carried it off
15,null,null,f everybody minded their own business
16,null,null,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
17,null,null,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
18,null,null,Which would NOT be an advantage
19,null,null,' said Alice
20,happiness,glad,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
2059 29
 (14, 13),
1,null,null,Oh
2,null,null,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
3,null,null,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
4,null,null,and very nearly carried it off
5,null,null,f everybody minded their own business
6,null,null,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
7,null,null,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
8,null,null,Which would NOT be an advantage
9,null,null,' said Alice
10,null,null,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night
11,null,null,You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis ' Talking of axes
12,null,null,' said the Duchess
13,null,null,chop off her head
14,fear,anxiously,' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook
15,null,null,to see if she meant to take the hint
16,null,null,but the cook was busily stirring the soup
17,null,null,and seemed not to be listening
18,null,null,so she went on again :   Twenty-four hours
19,null,null,I THINK
20,null,null,or is it twelve
21,null,null,I ' Oh
22,null,null,dont bother ME
23,null,null,' said the Duchess
24,null,null,I never could abide figures
25,null,null,' And with that she began nursing her child again
26,null,null,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
27,null,null,and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :   Speak roughly to your little boy
28,null,null,And beat him when he sneezes :  He only does it to annoy
29,null,null,Because he knows it teases . '
2060 18
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I dont quite understand you
2,null,null,' she said
3,null,null,as politely as she could The Dormouse is asleep again
4,null,null,' said the Hatter
5,disgust,impatiently,and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  .  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently
6,null,null,and said
7,null,null,without opening its eyes
8,null,null,Of course
9,null,null,of course
10,null,null,just what I was going to remark myself
11,null,null,Have you guessed the riddle yet
12,null,null,' the Hatter said
13,null,null,turning to Alice again No
14,null,null,I give it up
15,null,null,' Alice replied :   what 's the answer
16,null,null,'  I have n't the slightest idea
17,null,null,' said the Hatter Nor I
18,null,null,' said the March Hare
2061 31
 (20, 12),(20, 13),(20, 18),
1,null,null,Would you tell me
2,null,null,' said Alice
3,null,null,a little timidly
4,null,null,why you are painting those roses
5,null,null,' Five and Seven said nothing
6,null,null,but looked at Two  .  Two began in a low voice
7,null,null,Why the fact is
8,null,null,you see
9,null,null,Miss
10,null,null,this here ought to have been a RED rose tree
11,null,null,and we put a white one in by mistake
12,null,null,and if the Queen was to find it out
13,null,null,we should all have our heads cut off
14,null,null,you know
15,null,null,you see
16,null,null,Miss
17,null,null,we 're doing our best
18,null,null,afore she comes
19,null,null,to ' At this moment Five
20,fear,anxiously,who had been anxiously looking across the garden
21,null,null,called out  The Queen
22,null,null,The Queen
23,null,null,' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  .  There was a sound of many footsteps
24,null,null,and Alice looked round
25,null,null,eager to see the Queen  .  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs
26,null,null,these were all shaped like the three gardeners
27,null,null,oblong and flat
28,null,null,with their hands and feet at the corners :  next the ten courtiers
29,null,null,these were ornamented all over with diamonds
30,null,null,and walked two and two
31,null,null,as the soldiers did
2062 41
 (29, 29),
1,null,null,Idiot
2,null,null,' said the Queen
3,null,null,tossing her head impatiently
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,turning to Alice
6,null,null,she went on
7,null,null,What 's your name
8,null,null,child
9,null,null,'  My name is Alice
10,null,null,so please your Majesty
11,null,null,' said Alice very politely
12,null,null,but she added
13,null,null,to herself
14,null,null,Why
15,null,null,theyre only a pack of cards
16,null,null,after allI need n't be afraid of them
17,null,null,'  And who are THESE
18,null,null,' said the Queen
19,null,null,pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree
20,null,null,for
21,null,null,you see
22,null,null,as they were lying on their faces
23,null,null,and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack
24,null,null,she could not tell whether they were gardeners
25,null,null,or soldiers
26,null,null,or courtiers
27,null,null,or three of her own children How should I know
28,null,null,' said Alice
29,surprise,surprised,surprised at her own courage It 's no business of MINE
30,null,null,The Queen turned crimson with fury
31,null,null,and
32,null,null,after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast
33,null,null,screamed  Off with her head
34,null,null,Off '  Nonsense
35,null,null,' said Alice
36,null,null,very loudly and decidedly
37,null,null,and the Queen was silent  .  The King laid his hand upon her arm
38,null,null,and timidly said  Consider
39,null,null,my dear :  she is only a child
40,null,null,' The Queen turned angrily away from him
41,null,null,and said to the Knave  Turn them over
2063 18
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I said  "  What for
2,null,null,"  '  She boxed the Queen 's ears ' the Rabbit began . Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh
3,null,null,hush
4,fear,frightened,' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you
5,null,null,You see
6,null,null,she came rather late
7,null,null,and the Queen said '  Get to your places
8,null,null,' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
9,null,null,and people began running about in all directions
10,null,null,tumbling up against each other
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,they got settled down in a minute or two
13,null,null,and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life
14,null,null,it was all ridges and furrows
15,null,null,the balls were live hedgehogs
16,null,null,the mallets live flamingoes
17,null,null,and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet
18,null,null,to make the arches
2064 19
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
2,null,null,the fight was over
3,null,null,and both the hedgehogs were out of sight :   but it does n't matter much
4,null,null,' thought Alice
5,null,null,as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
6,null,null,So she tucked it away under her arm
7,null,null,that it might not escape again
8,null,null,and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  .  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat
9,surprise,surprised,she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it :  there was a dispute going on between the executioner
10,null,null,the King
11,null,null,and the Queen
12,null,null,who were all talking at once
13,null,null,while all the rest were quite silent
14,null,null,and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared
15,null,null,she was appealed to by all three to settle the question
16,null,null,and they repeated their arguments to her
17,null,null,though
18,null,null,as they all spoke at once
19,null,null,she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
2065 18
 (9, 10),(9, 13),
1,null,null,Thinking again
2,null,null,' the Duchess asked
3,null,null,with another dig of her sharp little chin i 've a right to think
4,null,null,' said Alice sharply
5,null,null,for she was beginning to feel a little worried Just about as much right
6,null,null,' said the Duchess
7,null,null,as pigs have to fly
8,null,null,and the m ' But here
9,surprise,to Alice 's great surprise,to Alice 's great surprise
10,null,null,the Duchess 's voice died away
11,null,null,even in the middle of her favourite word  moral
12,null,null,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up
13,null,null,and there stood the Queen in front of them
14,null,null,with her arms folded
15,null,null,frowning like a thunderstorm A fine day
16,null,null,your Majesty
17,null,null,' the Duchess began in a low
18,null,null,weak voice
2066 19
 (14, 8),(14, 9),
1,null,null,A fine day
2,null,null,your Majesty
3,null,null,' the Duchess began in a low
4,null,null,weak voice Now
5,null,null,I give you fair warning
6,null,null,' shouted the Queen
7,null,null,stamping on the ground as she spoke
8,null,null,either you or your head must be off
9,null,null,and that in about half no time
10,null,null,Take your choice
11,null,null,' The Duchess took her choice
12,null,null,and was gone in a moment Let 's go on with the game
13,null,null,' the Queen said to Alice
14,fear,frightened,and Alice was too much frightened to say a word
15,null,null,but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground . The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen 's absence
16,null,null,and were resting in the shade :  however
17,null,null,the moment they saw her
18,null,null,they hurried back to the game
19,null,null,the Queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives
2067 24
 (16, 16),
1,null,null,I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is
2,null,null,It 's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from
3,null,null,' said the Queen I never saw one
4,null,null,or heard of one
5,null,null,' said Alice Come on
6,null,null,then
7,null,null,' said the Queen
8,null,null,and he shall tell you his history
9,null,null,' As they walked off together
10,null,null,Alice heard the King say in a low voice
11,null,null,to the company generally
12,null,null,You are all pardoned
13,null,null,Come
14,null,null,THAT 's a good thing
15,null,null,' she said to herself
16,sadness,unhappy,for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered
17,null,null,ey very soon came upon a Gryphon
18,null,null,lying fast asleep in the sun ( IF you dont know what a Gryphon is
19,null,null,look at the picture
20,null,null,Up
21,null,null,lazy thing
22,null,null,' said the Queen
23,null,null,and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle
24,null,null,and to hear his history
2068 20
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,When we were little
2,null,null,' the Mock Turtle went on at last
3,null,null,more calmly
4,null,null,though still sobbing a little now and then
5,null,null,we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise '  Why did you call him Tortoise
6,null,null,if he wasnt one
7,null,null,' Alice asked We called him Tortoise because he taught us
8,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle angrily :   really you are very dull
9,sadness,ashamed,'  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
10,null,null,' added the Gryphon
11,null,null,and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice
12,null,null,who felt ready to sink into the earth . At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle
13,null,null,Drive on
14,null,null,old fellow
15,null,null,dont be all day about it
16,null,null,' and he went on in these words :   Yes
17,null,null,we went to school in the sea
18,null,null,though you may n't believe it '  I never said I didnt
19,null,null,' interrupted Alice You did
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle
2069 26
 (19, 17),
1,null,null,theyre done with blacking
2,null,null,I believe
3,null,null,Boots and shoes under the sea
4,null,null,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice
5,null,null,are done with a whiting . Now you know
6,null,null,And what are they made of
7,null,null,' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity Soles and eels
8,null,null,of course
9,null,null,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently :   any shrimp could have told you that
10,null,null,If i 'd been the whiting
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,whose thoughts were still running on the song
13,null,null,i 'd have said to the porpoise
14,null,null,"  Keep back
15,null,null,please :  we dont want YOU with us
16,null,null,"  '  They were obliged to have him with them
17,null,null,' the Mock Turtle said :   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
18,null,null,would n't it really
19,surprise,in a tone of great surprise,' said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle :   why
21,null,null,if a fish came to ME
22,null,null,and told me he was going a journey
23,null,null,I should say  "  With what porpoise
24,null,null,"  '  dont you mean  "  purpose "
25,null,null,' said Alice I mean what I say
26,null,null,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone
2071 28

1,null,null,Off with her head
2,null,null,' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved Who cares for you
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,( she had grown to her full size by this time
5,null,null,you 're nothing but a pack of cards
6,null,null,' At this the whole pack rose up into the air
7,null,null,and came flying down upon her :  she gave a little scream
8,fear,half of fright and half of anger,half of fright and half of anger
9,null,null,and tried to beat them off
10,null,null,and found herself lying on the bank
11,null,null,with her head in the lap of her sister
12,null,null,who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up
13,null,null,Alice dear
14,null,null,' said her sister
15,null,null,Why
16,null,null,what a long sleep you 've had
17,null,null,'  Oh
18,null,null,i 've had such a curious dream
19,null,null,' said Alice
20,null,null,and she told her sister
21,null,null,as well as she could remember them
22,null,null,all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
23,null,null,and when she had finished
24,null,null,her sister kissed her
25,null,null,and said
26,null,null,It WAS a curious dream
27,null,null,dear
28,null,null,certainly :  but now run in to your tea

1,null,null,' good Uncle
2,happiness,excitement,' cried the maiden in eager excitement
3,null,null,' there is a guest coming
4,null,null,He has just turned over the brae side
5,null,null,and can be coming nowhere but here . '
2073 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Patrick 's face cleared
2,fear,feared,It was no grace or beauty that he feared in any stranger
3,null,null,but the sheer might and un right that their Regency enabled the House of Albany to exercise over the orphans of the royal family
4,null,null,whose head was absent
5,null,null,and a captive knight could be no mischievous person
6,null,null,Still this might be only a specious pretence to impose on the chaplain
7,null,null,and gain admittance to the castle
8,null,null,and Patrick was resolved to be well on his guard
9,null,null,though he replied courteously to the graceful bow with which the stranger greeted him
10,null,null,saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent
11,null,null,' i have been bold enough to presume on the good father 's offer of hospitality
12,null,null,Sir . '
2075 13
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Lilias sat between her uncle and his guest
2,disgust,jealousy,looking so fair and bright that Patrick felt fresh accesses of angry jealousy
3,null,null,while the visitor talked as one able to report to the natives from another world
4,null,null,and that world the hateful England
5,null,null,which as a Scotsman he was bound to abhor
6,null,null,Had it been France
7,null,null,it had been endurable
8,null,null,but praise of English habits was mere disloyalty
9,null,null,and yet
10,null,null,whenever Patrick tried to throw in a disparaging word
11,null,null,he found himself met with a quiet superiority such as he had believed no knight in Scotland could assume with him
12,null,null,and still it was neither brow beating nor insolence
13,null,null,nothing that could give offence .
2077 23
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,There was an eager pressing round to hear
2,null,null,and not only were Lilias and Malcolm
3,null,null,but old Sir David himself
4,null,null,much affected by the strain
5,null,null,which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III
6,null,null,which
7,null,null,sad as they were
8,null,null,now seemed like good old times
9,null,null,so much worse was the present state of affairs
10,null,null,Sir James
11,null,null,however
12,fear,anxious,seemed anxious to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung
13,null,null,and applied to Malcolm to give a specimen of his powers :   and thus
14,null,null,with music
15,null,null,ballad
16,null,null,and lay
17,null,null,the evening passed away
18,null,null,till the parting cup was sent round
19,null,null,and the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep
20,null,null,in a wainscoted box bedstead
21,null,null,and his two attendant squires
22,null,null,a great iron gray Scot and a rosy honest faced Englishman
23,null,null,on pallets on the floor .
2078 29
 (22, 22),
1,null,null,They were
2,null,null,in effect
3,null,null,riding somewhat carelessly
4,null,null,and with the ease of men whose feat was performed
5,null,null,and who expected no more opposition Full in the midst was Lilias
6,null,null,entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her
7,null,null,and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse
8,null,null,ridden by a slender
9,null,null,light limbed
10,null,null,wiry groom
11,null,null,whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall
12,null,null,a retainer of the Duke of Albany
13,null,null,and beside him rode her captor
14,null,null,Sir Walter Stewart
15,null,null,a man little above twenty
16,null,null,but with a bronzed
17,null,null,hardened
18,null,null,reckless expression that made him look much older
19,null,null,and of huge height and giant build . Malcolm knew him well
20,null,null,and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread
21,null,null,both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father
22,fear,fear,from fear of his intentions
23,null,null,and from the misery that his brutal jests
24,null,null,scoffs
25,null,null,and practical jokes had often personally inflicted :   and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst fears But ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror
26,null,null,Sir James 's shout of  ' st andrew for the right
27,null,null,' was ringing out
28,null,null,echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him
29,null,null,as simultaneously they leapt forward
2079 2
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,And for all Malcolm 's anxiety for his uncle
2,null,null,his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self respect .
2080 27
 (25, 26),(25, 27),
1,null,null,' kinsman
2,null,null,' thought Malcolm
3,null,null,' do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal
4,null,null,' but then
5,null,null,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,null,null,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,null,null,and so kind to himself
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,null,null,dismounted
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,as John said
13,null,null,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,null,null,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,null,null,sheltered from the wind
16,null,null,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,null,null,dried fish
18,null,null,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,null,null,in a bright warm sunshine
20,null,null,and Hal
21,null,null,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,null,null,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,null,null,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,null,null,seated himself on the grass
25,surprise,surprise,and to Malcolm 's extreme surprise
26,null,null,not to say disgust
27,null,null,was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap .
2081 13
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,He was glad that his own Sir James was equal in dignity
2,null,null,as well as superior in height
3,null,null,and he thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible to the sparkling azure eyes of the Englishman
4,null,null,steadfast
5,null,null,keen
6,null,null,and brilliant unspeakably though they were
7,null,null,but so soon as Sir James seemed to have made his explanation
8,null,null,the look was most winningly turned on him
9,null,null,a hand held out
10,null,null,and he was thus greeted :   ' welcome
11,null,null,my young Prince Malcolm
12,happiness,happy,I am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer
13,null,null,that he has brought you to partake it . '
2084 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,' would Douglas but so fight in any good quarrel
2,null,null,' sighed the King
3,null,null,' but what are you longing to ask
4,null,null,Malcolm
5,null,null,Is it for your kinsman Patrick
6,fear,fear,I fear me that there is little chance of your hearing by name of him . '

2,null,null,ashamed to say he was royal

3,null,null,and much in awe of her future mother-in-law
4,null,null,a stiff and stately dame
5,null,null,with all the Beaufort haughtiness
6,null,null,so that Lady Westmoreland gladly and graciously consented to the offer of the Demoiselle de Luxemburg to attend to the little maiden
7,null,null,and let her share her chamber and her bed .
2089 25
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,' lo you now

12,null,null,what with use
13,null,null,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,null,null,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle

16,null,null,indeed

1,fear,feared,James feared he had been mistaken
2,null,null,and looked to the influence of Esclairmonde to repair the evil
3,null,null,if perchance she should follow the Queen to France
4,null,null,And this it was almost certain she must do
5,null,null,since she was entirely dependent upon the Countess of Hainault
6,null,null,and could not obtain admission to a nunnery without recovering a portion of her estates .
2097 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Would she be there
2,fear,anxiety,That was the chief anxiety :   for it was not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on the Continent
3,null,null,and Catherine had given no intimation as to who would be in her suite so that
4,null,null,as Henry had merrily observed
5,null,null,he was the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense
6,null,null,except indeed Salisbury
7,null,null,who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come out with the Queen .

2,null,null,the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy

4,null,null,and even press to his lips
5,null,null,his lady 's first love letter
6,null,null,in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford
7,null,null,of whom he eagerly asked of the fair Joan 's health and welfare
8,null,null,and whether she were flouted by Queen Catherine .
2099 11
 (10, 7),(10, 10),

3,null,null,the whitest of kirtle

5,null,null,the flush of anxiety on the pale little face made it so fair to look upon
6,null,null,that as the maiden wistfully asked
7,null,null,' think you he will flout me

11,null,null,in strong terms
12,null,null,laid the case before him

17,null,null,and that
18,null,null,unless Hugh Sorel demanded anything absolutely sinful of his daughter
19,null,null,it was needful that she should submit
20,null,null,He repeated
21,null,null,in stronger terms
22,null,null,the assurance that she would be protected in the endeavour to do right
23,null,null,and the Divine promises which he quoted from the Latin Scriptures gave some comfort to the niece
24,null,null,who understood them
25,null,null,while they impressed the aunt

28,null,null,whether the young lady died or recovered
29,null,null,the conclusion of her illness would be the term of Christina 's stay at Adlerstein

5,null,null,had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed

7,null,null,She looked up
8,null,null,and saw on the pathway above her a tall

10,null,null,his skin dyed red with sun and wind
11,null,null,in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair
12,null,null,moustache
13,null,null,and beard

4,null,null,on the unmistakable evidence that her heart had spoken
5,null,null,and her grave dignity had less effect in silencing them than usual
6,null,null,so diverting was the alleged triumph over her propriety
7,null,null,well as they knew that she would have done the same for the youngest horse boy
8,null,null,or the oldest man-at-arms .

2,happiness,happy,Esclairmonde and Alice were very happy in this secret hope
3,null,null,but at the end of that time the Bishop of Therouenne appeared
4,null,null,Esclairmonde had ventured to hope that the King 's influence
5,null,null,and likewise the fact that her intention was not to enrich one of the regular monastic orders
6,null,null,might lead him to lend a favourable ear to her scheme
7,null,null,but she was by no means prepared to find him already informed of the affair of the Dance of Death

1,null,null,If the illness had only been confessed
2,null,null,those who watched the King anxiously would have had more hope
3,anger,angered,but he was hotly angered at any hint of his needing care
4,null,null,and though he sometimes relieved oppression by causing himself to be bled by a servant
5,null,null,he never allowed that anything ailed him
6,null,null,it was always the hot weather
7,null,null,the anxious tidings
8,null,null,the long pageant that wearied him things that were wont to be like gnats on a lion 's mane .
2110 24
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,Here were the malicious defraud ers of the hungry warriors
2,null,null,Down upon them flew the angry foragers
3,null,null,Soon the pretty tranquil scene was ringing with the oaths of the plundering and the cries of the plundered
4,null,null,the cattle were being driven off
5,null,null,the houses and farm yards rifled
6,null,null,blood was flowing
7,null,null,and what could not be carried off was burning
8,null,null,The search for the Armagnac prisoner had
9,null,null,however
10,null,null,relaxed after the first inquiry
11,null,null,and Malcolm
12,surprise,surprised,surprised that this had been forgotten
13,null,null,suddenly bethought him of the distinction he should secure by sending a valuable prize to Esclairmonde 's feet
14,null,null,He seized on an old man who had not been able to fly
15,null,null,and stood trembling and panting in a corner
16,null,null,and demanded where the sick man was
17,null,null,The old man pointed to a farmhouse
18,null,null,round which clouds of smoke were rolling
19,null,null,and Malcolm hurried into it
20,null,null,shouting
21,null,null,' dog of an Armagnac
22,null,null,come out
23,null,null,Yield
24,null,null,ere thou be burnt
2111 16
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy
2,null,null,summoned Sir Nigel to his side
3,null,null,closed his own visor
4,null,null,and called for water
5,null,null,then hung over the prisoner
6,fear,anxious,anxious to prevent the first word from being broad Scotch
7,null,null,In the free air
8,null,null,some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life
9,null,null,and James at once said
10,null,null,' rendez vous
11,null,null,My Lord
12,null,null,' but he neither answered
13,null,null,nor was there meaning in his eyes
14,null,null,And James perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs
15,null,null,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,null,null,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms .
2112 35
 (31, 29),(31, 30),
1,null,null,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy

15,null,null,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,null,null,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms
17,null,null,He swooned again at the first attempt to lift him
18,null,null,and a hay cart having been left in the flight of the marauders
19,null,null,he was laid in it
20,null,null,and covered with the King 's cloak
21,null,null,to be conveyed to Corbeil
22,null,null,where James trusted to secure his life by personal intercession with Henry
23,null,null,He groaned heavily several times
24,null,null,but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way
25,null,null,and James and Sir Nigel kept on either side of the cart
26,null,null,ready to address him in French the first moment
27,null,null,having told the English that he was a prisoner of quality
28,null,null,who must be carefully conveyed to King James 's tent at Corbeil
29,null,null,Malcolm was not allowed to approach
30,null,null,lest he should be recognized
31,sadness,in an agony of shame and suspense,and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense
32,null,null,with very different feelings towards Patrick than those with which he had of late thought of him
33,null,null,or of his own promises
34,null,null,If Patrick died through this plundering raid
35,null,null,how should he ever face Lily
2113 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Nothing had passed about Patrick Drummond
2,null,null,nor the high words of last night
3,null,null,Henry seemed to have forgotten them
4,fear,anxiety,between his bodily suffering and the anxiety of being forced to relinquish the command just before a battle
5,null,null,and James would have felt it ungenerous to harass him at such a moment
6,null,null,when absolutely committed to his charge
7,null,null,For the present
8,null,null,there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority
9,null,null,since the King had promised to take cognizance of the case
10,null,null,and the chief danger was from his chance discovery by some lawless man-at-arms
11,null,null,who would think himself doing good service by killing a concealed Scot under any circumstances .
2114 26
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,Patrick 's life was granted
2,null,null,although it had been promised too late to send the intelligence back to the tent at Corbeil
3,null,null,So far
4,null,null,the purpose of his vow to St
5,null,null,Andrew had been accomplished
6,null,null,but with the probability that he should soon again be associated with Patrick
7,null,null,came the sense of the failure in purpose and in promise
8,null,null,Patrick would not reproach him
9,null,null,he well knew nay
10,null,null,would rejoice in the change
11,null,null,but even this certainty galled him
12,sadness,shame,and made him dread his cousin 's presence as likely to bring him a sense of shame
13,null,null,What would Patrick think of his letting a lady be absolutely compelled to marry him
14,null,null,Might he not say it was the part of Walter Stewart over again
15,null,null,Indeed
16,null,null,Malcolm remembered how carefully King James was prevented from hearing the means by which the Countess intended to make the lady his own
17,null,null,and a sensation came over him
18,null,null,that it was profanation to call on St
19,null,null,Andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means
20,null,null,Why was it that
21,null,null,as his eyes fell on the face of King Henry
22,null,null,the whole world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring
23,null,null,and a sentence he had once heard Esclairmonde quote would come to him constantly :   ' my son
24,null,null,think not to buy off God
25,null,null,It is thyself that He requires
26,null,null,not thy gifts . '
2116 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Ermentrude
2,null,null,she found
3,null,null,meant to go down
4,null,null,but with no notion of the personal arrangements that Christina had been wont to think a needful preliminary
5,null,null,With all her hair streaming
6,null,null,down she went
7,null,null,and was so gladly welcomed by her father that it was plain that her presence was regarded as an unusual advance towards recovery
8,fear,feared,and Christina feared lest he might already be looking out for the stout husband
9,null,null,She had much to tell him about the catskin cloak
10,null,null,and then she was seized with eager curiosity at the sight of Christina 's bundles
11,null,null,and especially at her lute
12,null,null,which she must hear at once .
2117 7
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,And this was Christina 's charge
2,null,null,whom she must look upon as the least alien spirit in this dreadful castle of banishment
3,null,null,The young and old lords seemed to her savage bandits
4,null,null,who frightened her only less than did the proud sinister expression of the old lady
5,null,null,for she had not even the merit of showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl
6,sadness,ashamed,of whom she was ashamed
7,null,null,and evidently regarded the town bred attendant as a contemptible interloper .
2119 30
 (14, 13),(14, 14),
1,null,null,Therewith she made a great difference in the aspect of the chamber
2,null,null,under the full sanction of the lords of the castle
3,null,null,Wolf
4,null,null,deer
5,null,null,and sheep skins abounded
6,null,null,and with these
7,null,null,assisted by her father and old Hatto
8,null,null,she tapestry ied the lower part of the bare grim walls
9,null,null,a great bear 's hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth
10,null,null,and cushions were made of these skins
11,null,null,and stuffed from Ursel 's stores of feathers
12,null,null,All these embellishments were watched with great delight by Ermentrude
13,null,null,who had never been made of so much importance
14,surprise,surprised,and was as much surprised as relieved by such attentions
15,null,null,She was too young and too delicate to reject civilization
16,null,null,and she let Christina braid her hair
17,null,null,bathe her
18,null,null,and arrange her dress
19,null,null,with sensations of comfort that were almost like health
20,null,null,To train her into occupying herself was however
21,null,null,as Christina soon found
22,null,null,in her present state
23,null,null,impossible
24,null,null,She could spin and sew a little
25,null,null,but hated both
26,null,null,and her clumsy
27,null,null,listless fingers only soiled and wasted Christina 's needles
28,null,null,silk
29,null,null,and lute strings
30,null,null,and such damage was not so easily remedied as in the streets of Ulm .
2122 26
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,So the door remained shut
2,null,null,and Christina 's resolve was taken that she would so keep it while the wine lasted
3,null,null,And
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,Ermentrude had so much fever all that night and the next day that no going down could be thought of
6,null,null,Nobody came near the maidens but Ursel
7,disgust,fear and disgust,and she described one continued orgies that made Christina shudder again with fear and disgust
8,null,null,Those below revelled without interval
9,null,null,except for sleep
10,null,null,and they took their sleep just where they happened to sink down
11,null,null,then returned again to the liquor
12,null,null,The old baroness repaired to the kitchen when the revelry went beyond even her bearing
13,null,null,but all the time the wine held out
14,null,null,the swine in the court were
15,null,null,as Ursel averred
16,null,null,better company than the men in the hall
17,null,null,Yet there might have been worse even than this
18,null,null,for old Ursel whispered that at the bottom of the stairs there was a trap door
19,null,null,Did the maiden know what it covered
20,null,null,It was an oubliette
21,null,null,There was once a Strasburg armourer who had refused ransom
22,null,null,and talked of appealing to the Kaiser
23,null,null,He trod on that door and Ursel pointed downwards
24,null,null,"  But since that time
25,null,null,"   she said
26,null,null,"  my young lord has never brought home a prisoner .  "
2123 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Christina dreaded indeed that the roads should be open
2,null,null,but she could not love the snow
3,null,null,it spoke to her of dreariness
4,null,null,savagery
5,null,null,and captivity
6,null,null,and she watched the dwindling stripes with satisfaction
7,happiness,rejoiced,and hailed the fall of the petty avalanches from one Eagle 's Step to another as her forefathers might have rejoiced in the defeat of the Frost giants .

1,null,null,Do you include violin playing in your category of rows
2,null,null,he asked
3,fear,anxiously,anxiously
4,null,null,He was not studying medicine
5,null,null,He had himself
6,null,null,in reply to a question
7,null,null,confirmed Stamford  s opinion upon that point
8,null,null,Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance in to the learned world .
2125 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable
2,surprise,astounded,and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me
3,null,null,Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view
4,null,null,Desultory readers are seldom  remarkable for the exactness of their learning .

1,disgust,contempt,Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt
2,null,null,They evidently failed to appreciate the fact

4,null,null,that Sherlock Holmes  s smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end .
2127 9

1,null,null,It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I were to presume to help you
2,null,null,remarked my friend
3,null,null,You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere
4,null,null,There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke
5,null,null,If you will let me know how your investigations go
6,null,null,he continued
7,happiness,happy,I shall be happy to give you any help I can
8,null,null,In the mean time I should like to speak to the constable who found the body
9,null,null,Can you give me his name and address

 (4, 5),

2,null,null,who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince 's  fury as all the rest they had seen
3,null,null,were at a loss to unravel this new  circumstance
4,surprise,more astonished,The young peasant himself was still more astonished
5,null,null,not conceiving how he had offended the Prince
6,null,null,Yet recollecting  himself
7,null,null,with a mixture of grace and humility
8,null,null,he disengaged himself  from Manfred 's grip
9,null,null,and then with an obeisance
10,null,null,which discovered more  jealousy of innocence than dismay
11,null,null,he asked
12,null,null,with respect
13,null,null,of what he  was guilty
14,null,null,Manfred
15,null,null,more enraged at the vigour
16,null,null,however decently  exerted
17,null,null,with which the young man had shaken off his hold
18,null,null,than  appeased by his submission
19,null,null,ordered his attendants to seize him
20,null,null,and
21,null,null,if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the  nuptials
22,null,null,would have poignarded the peasant in their arms .

1,null,null,She was too well acquainted with her father 's impetuosity to venture a  second intrusion
2,null,null,When she had a little recovered the shock of so  bitter a reception
3,null,null,she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional  stab that the knowledge of it would give to Hippolita
4,fear,in the most anxious,who questioned  her in the most anxious terms on the health of Manfred
5,null,null,and how he  bore his loss

6,null,null,if he should succeed by the Friar 's mediation

7,null,null,and was informed  that he was no retainer
8,null,null,but an enemy
9,null,null,of Manfred

5,null,null,a good-humoured woman

7,null,null,and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village
8,null,null,she must seek them abroad

 (5, 4),
1,null,null,When the hour of departure drew near
2,null,null,the maternal anxiety of Mrs
3,null,null,Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe
4,null,null,A thousand alarming presentiment of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness
5,sadness,drown her in tears,and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together
6,null,null,and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet
7,null,null,Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house
8,null,null,must
9,null,null,at such a moment
10,null,null,relieve the fulness of her heart .
2380 11
 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Under these unpromising auspices
2,null,null,the parting took place
3,null,null,and the journey began
4,null,null,It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety
5,null,null,Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them
6,null,null,nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero
7,fear,fear,Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear
8,null,null,on Mrs
9,null,null,Allen 's side
10,null,null,of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn
11,null,null,and that fortunately proved to be groundless .

2387 5
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours
2,happiness,thankfully,it was thankfully accepted
3,null,null,and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it
4,null,null,which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening
5,null,null,till they were discovered and joined by Mr Allen when the dance was over .

21,null,null,in his natural tone

2402 14
 (6, 2),
1,null,null,The whole being explained
2,null,null,many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her

5,null,null,etc
6,happiness,pleasure,which Catherine heard with pleasure
7,null,null,and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,as the first proof of amity
10,null,null,she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe
11,null,null,and take a turn with her about the room
12,null,null,Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance
13,null,null,and almost forgot Mr Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe
14,null,null,Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love .

1,null,null,As soon as divine service was over
2,null,null,the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other
3,null,null,and after staying long enough in the pump room to discover that the crowd was insupportable
4,null,null,and that there was not a genteel face to be seen
5,null,null,which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season
6,null,null,they hastened away to the Crescent
7,null,null,to breathe the fresh air of better company
8,null,null,Here Catherine and Isabella
9,null,null,arm in arm
10,null,null,again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation

7,null,null,I have an hundred things to say to you
8,null,null,In the first place
9,fear,afraid,I was so afraid it would rain this morning
10,null,null,just as I wanted to set off
11,null,null,it looked very showery
12,null,null,and that would have thrown me into agonies
13,null,null,Do you know
14,null,null,I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine
15,null,null,in a shop window in Milsom Street just now   very like yours
16,null,null,only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green

20,null,null,what have you been doing with yourself all this morning
21,null,null,Have you gone on with Udolpho

1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,that I do
3,null,null,There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends
4,null,null,I have no notion of loving people by halves
5,null,null,it is not my nature
6,null,null,My attachments are always excessively strong
7,null,null,I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night
8,null,null,I would not dance with him
9,null,null,unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel
10,null,null,The men think us incapable of real friendship
11,null,null,you know
12,null,null,and I am determined to show them the difference
13,null,null,Now
14,null,null,if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you
15,anger,fire up,I should fire up in a moment :  but that is not at all likely
16,null,null,for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men .  "
2413 15
 (6, 2),
1,null,null,"  But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr Tilney
2,null,null,for perhaps I may never see him again

12,null,null,I feel as if nobody could make me miserable
13,null,null,The dreadful black veil
14,null,null,My dear Isabella

5,null,null,It is not like Udolpho at all
6,null,null,but yet I think it is very entertaining

8,surprise,surprise,You surprise me
9,null,null,I thought it had not been readable
10,null,null,But
11,null,null,my dearest Catherine
12,null,null,have you settled what to wear on your head tonight

2,null,null,' tis James
3,null,null,"   was uttered at the same moment by Catherine
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,on catching the young men 's eyes
6,null,null,the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches
7,null,null,and the servant having now scampered up
8,null,null,the gentlemen jumped out
9,null,null,and the equipage was delivered to his care
10,null,null,Catherine
11,null,null,by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected
12,happiness,liveliest pleasure,received her brother with the liveliest pleasure
13,null,null,and he
14,null,null,being of a very amiable disposition
15,null,null,and sincerely attached to her
16,null,null,gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction
17,null,null,which he could have leisure to do
18,null,null,while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice
19,null,null,and to her his devoir were speedily paid
20,null,null,with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine
21,null,null,had she been more expert in the development of other people 's feelings
22,null,null,and less simply engrossed by her own
23,null,null,that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself .
2421 11
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,"  And I am sure
2,null,null,"   said Catherine
3,null,null,"  I know so little of such things that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear
4,null,null,Neither one nor the other
5,null,null,I might have got it for less
6,null,null,I dare say
7,null,null,but I hate haggling
8,null,null,and poor Freeman wanted cash
9,null,null,That was very good natured of you
10,null,null,"   said Catherine
11,happiness,pleased,quite pleased .
2423 17
 (16, 17),
1,null,null,"  I think you must like Udolpho
2,null,null,if you were to read it
3,null,null,it is so very interesting
4,null,null,"  Not I
5,null,null,faith
6,null,null,No
7,null,null,if I read any
8,null,null,it shall be Mrs
9,null,null,Radcliffe 's
10,null,null,her novels are amusing enough
11,null,null,they are worth reading
12,null,null,some fun and nature in them
13,null,null,"  Udolpho was written by Mrs
14,null,null,Radcliffe
15,null,null,"   said Catherine
16,fear,hesitation,with some hesitation
17,null,null,from the fear of mortifying him .

2428 24
 (16, 9),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,very much indeed
3,null,null,I fancy
4,null,null,Mr Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath
5,null,null,"  I dare say he does
6,null,null,and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr Allen
7,null,null,I need not ask you whether you are happy here
8,null,null,my dear Catherine
9,null,null,with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe
10,null,null,it would be impossible for you to be otherwise
11,null,null,and the Allens
12,null,null,I am sure
13,null,null,are very kind to you
14,null,null,"    "  Yes
15,null,null,very kind
16,happiness,happy,I never was so happy before
17,null,null,and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever
18,null,null,how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me
19,null,null,James accepted this tribute of gratitude
20,null,null,and qualified his conscience for accepting it too
21,null,null,by saying with perfect sincerity
22,null,null,"  Indeed
23,null,null,Catherine
24,null,null,I love you dearly .  "
2429 18
 (18, 18),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,very much indeed
3,null,null,I fancy
4,null,null,Mr Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath

18,happiness,good,how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me .  "
2430 9
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before them
2,happiness,smiling,and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste
3,null,null,of admiring the set of her gown
4,null,null,and envying the curl of her hair
5,null,null,they followed their chaperones
6,null,null,arm in arm
7,null,null,into the ballroom
8,null,null,whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred
9,null,null,and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection .
2432 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing
2,null,null,Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs
3,null,null,Thorpe and Mrs
4,null,null,Allen
5,null,null,between whom she now remained
6,anger,vexed,She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr Thorpe
7,null,null,for she not only longed to be dancing
8,null,null,but was likewise aware that
9,null,null,as the real dignity of her situation could not be known
10,null,null,she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner .
2434 13
 (11, 12),
1,null,null,From this state of humiliation
2,null,null,she was roused
3,null,null,at the end of ten minutes
4,null,null,to a more pleasant feeling
5,null,null,by seeing
6,null,null,not Mr Thorpe
7,null,null,but Mr Tilney
8,null,null,within three yards of the place where they sat
9,null,null,he seemed to be moving that way
10,null,null,but he did not see her
11,happiness,smile,and therefore the smile and the blush
12,null,null,which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine
13,null,null,passed away without sullying her heroic importance .
2435 19
 (15, 14),
1,null,null,Mr Tilney and his companion
2,null,null,who continued
3,null,null,though slowly
4,null,null,to approach
5,null,null,were immediately preceded by a lady
6,null,null,an acquaintance of Mrs
7,null,null,Thorpe
8,null,null,and this lady stopping to speak to her
9,null,null,they
10,null,null,as belonging to her
11,null,null,stopped likewise
12,null,null,and Catherine
13,null,null,catching Mr Tilney 's eye
14,null,null,instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition
15,happiness,pleasure,She returned it with pleasure
16,null,null,and then advancing still nearer
17,null,null,he spoke both to her and Mrs
18,null,null,Allen
19,null,null,by whom he was very civilly acknowledged .
2436 26
 (25, 13),
1,null,null,"  I tell you
2,null,null,Mr Morland
3,null,null,"   she cried
4,null,null,"  I would not do such a thing for all the world
5,null,null,How can you be so teasing
6,null,null,only conceive
7,null,null,my dear Catherine
8,null,null,what your brother wants me to do
9,null,null,He wants me to dance with him again
10,null,null,though I tell him that it is a most improper thing
11,null,null,and entirely against the rules
12,null,null,It would make us the talk of the place
13,null,null,if we were not to change partners
14,null,null,"  Upon my honour
15,null,null,"   said James
16,null,null,"  in these public assemblies
17,null,null,it is as often done as not
18,null,null,"  Nonsense
19,null,null,how can you say so
20,null,null,But when you men have a point to carry
21,null,null,you never stick at anything
22,null,null,My sweet Catherine
23,null,null,do support me
24,null,null,persuade your brother how impossible it is
25,surprise,shock,Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing
26,null,null,now would not it
2438 25
 (25, 2),(25, 3),
1,null,null,"  Ah
2,null,null,He has got a partner
3,null,null,I wish he had asked you
4,null,null,"   said Mrs
5,null,null,Allen
6,null,null,and after a short silence
7,null,null,she added
8,null,null,"  he is a very agreeable young man
9,null,null,"  Indeed he is
10,null,null,Mrs
11,null,null,Allen
12,null,null,"   said Mrs
13,null,null,Thorpe
14,null,null,smiling complacently
15,null,null,"  I must say it
16,null,null,though I am his mother
17,null,null,that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
18,null,null,This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many
19,null,null,but it did not puzzle Mrs
20,null,null,Allen
21,null,null,for after only a moment 's consideration
22,null,null,she said
23,null,null,in a whisper to Catherine
24,null,null,"  I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son
25,anger,vexed,Catherine was disappointed and vexed .
2439 13
 (1, 5),
1,fear,frightened,"  You will not be frightened
2,null,null,Miss Morland
3,null,null,"   said Thorpe
4,null,null,as he handed her in
5,null,null,"  if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off
6,null,null,He will
7,null,null,most likely
8,null,null,give a plunge or two
9,null,null,and perhaps take the rest for a minute
10,null,null,but he will soon know his master
11,null,null,He is full of spirits
12,null,null,playful as can be
13,null,null,but there is no vice in him .  "

 (14, 6),
1,null,null,"  Break down
2,null,null,Oh
3,null,null,Lord
4,null,null,Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life
5,null,null,There is not a sound piece of iron about it
6,null,null,The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least   and as for the body
7,null,null,Upon my soul
8,null,null,you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch
9,null,null,It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld
10,null,null,Thank God
11,null,null,we have got a better
12,null,null,I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds
13,null,null,"  Good heavens

15,null,null,quite frightened .

2443 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,When they arrived at Mrs
2,null,null,Allen 's door
3,surprise,astonishment,the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed
4,null,null,on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house :   "  Past three o'clock
5,null,null,"   It was inconceivable
6,null,null,incredible
7,null,null,impossible
2444 16
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,And she would neither believe her own watch
2,null,null,nor her brother 's
3,null,null,nor the servant 's
4,null,null,she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality
5,null,null,till Morland produced his watch
6,null,null,and ascertained the fact
7,null,null,to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable
8,null,null,incredible
9,null,null,and impossible
10,null,null,and she could only protest
11,null,null,over and over again
12,null,null,that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before
13,null,null,as Catherine was called on to confirm
14,null,null,Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella
15,sadness,misery,but the latter was spared the misery of her friend 's dissenting voice
16,null,null,by not waiting for her answer .
2445 10
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Her own feelings entirely engrossed her
2,sadness,wretchedness,her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home
3,null,null,It was ages since she had had a moment 's conversation with her dearest Catherine
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,though she had such thousands of things to say to her
6,null,null,it appeared as if they were never to be together again
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,with sniffles of most exquisite misery
9,null,null,and the laughing eye of utter despondency
10,null,null,she bade her friend adieu and went on .
2446 10
 (8, 2),(8, 10),
1,null,null,Her own feelings entirely engrossed her

2449 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Catherine 's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning
2,null,null,and till the usual moment of going to the pump room
3,fear,alarm,she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention .
2450 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend
2,null,null,by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney
3,happiness,joyfully,whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs Hughes
4,null,null,and whom she instantly joined
5,null,null,with a firmer determination to be acquainted
6,null,null,than she might have had courage to command
7,null,null,had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before .
2451 9
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before
2,happiness,exulting,She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe
3,null,null,and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight
4,null,null,lest he should engage her again
5,null,null,for though she could not
6,null,null,dared not expect that Mr Tilney should ask her a third time to dance
7,null,null,her wishes
8,null,null,hopes
9,null,null,and plans all centred in nothing less .
2453 9
 (9, 7),(9, 9),
1,null,null,So Fledge came lower and lower
2,null,null,As they came down nearer to the earth and among the hills
3,null,null,the air grew warmer and after travelling so many hours with nothing to listen to but the beat of Fledge 's wings
4,null,null,it was nice to hear the homely and earthy noises again - the chatter of the river on its stony bed and the creaking of trees in the light wind
5,null,null,A warm
6,null,null,good smell of sun baked earth and grass and flowers came up to them
7,null,null,At last Fledge alighted
8,null,null,Digory rolled off and helped Polly to dismount
9,happiness,glad,Both were glad  to stretch their stiff legs .
2455 20
 (20, 12),
1,null,null,"  Well
2,null,null,tuck in
3,null,null,"   said Fledge
4,null,null,taking a big mouthful of grass
5,null,null,Then he raised his head
6,null,null,still chewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers
7,null,null,and said
8,null,null,"  Come on
9,null,null,you two
10,null,null,dont be shy
11,null,null,There 's plenty for us all
12,null,null,"  But we cant eat grass
13,null,null,"   said Digory
14,null,null,"  Hmm
15,null,null,hmm
16,null,null,"   said Fledge
17,null,null,speaking with his mouth full
18,null,null,"  Well - hmm - dont know quite what youll do then
19,null,null,Very good grass too
20,sadness,stared at one another in dismay,Polly and Digory stared at one another in dismay .
2456 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,When Fledge had quite finished his own excellent supper he lay down
2,null,null,The children came and sat one on each side of him leaning against his warm body
3,happiness,snug,and when he had spread a wing over each they were really quite snug
4,null,null,As the bright young stars of that new world came out they talked over everything :  how Digory had hoped to get something for his Mother and how
5,null,null,instead of that
6,null,null,he had been sent on this message .
2457 13
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Fledge came lower and lower in wide circles
2,null,null,The icy peaks rose up higher and higher above
3,null,null,The air came up warmer and sweeter every moment
4,happiness,brought the tears to your eyes,so sweet that it almost brought the tears to your eyes
5,null,null,Fledge was now gliding with his wings spread out motionless on each side
6,null,null,and his hoofs pawing for the ground
7,null,null,The steep green hill was rushing towards them
8,null,null,A moment later he alighted on its slope
9,null,null,a little awkwardly
10,null,null,The children rolled off
11,null,null,fell without hurting themselves on the warm
12,null,null,fine grass
13,null,null,and stood up panting a little .
2459 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,WELL done
2,null,null,"   said Aslan in a voice that made the earth shake
3,null,null,Then Digory knew that all the Narnians had heard those words and that the story of them would be handed down from father to son in that new world for hundreds of years and perhaps forever
4,null,null,But he was in no danger of feeling conceited for he didnt think about it at all now that he was face to face with Aslan
5,null,null,This time he found he could look straight into the Lion 's eyes
6,happiness,felt absolutely content,He had forgotten his troubles and felt absolutely content .
2460 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,And he was sure now that her face looked a little different
2,null,null,He bent down and kissed her very softly and stole out of the room with a beating heart
3,null,null,taking the core of the apple with him
4,null,null,For the rest of that day
5,null,null,whenever he looked at the things about him
6,null,null,and saw how ordinary and un magical they were
7,null,null,he hardly dared to hope
8,happiness,did hope,but when he remembered the face of Aslan he did hope .
2461 3
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,in great peace and joy,In Narnia the Beasts lived in great peace and joy and neither the Witch nor any other enemy came to trouble that pleasant land for many hundred years
2,null,null,King Frank and Queen Helen and their children lived happily in Narnia and their second son became King of Archenland
3,null,null,The boys married nymphs and the girls married wood gods and river gods .
2462 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,It was of course the Lion 's voice
2,surprise,lovely and terrible shock,The children had long felt sure that he could speak :  yet it was a lovely and terrible shock when he did .
2463 9
 (3, 3),(3, 8),
1,null,null,"  Good old Strawberry
2,null,null,"   said Polly
3,happiness,glad,"  I am glad he was one of the ones picked out to be a Talking Beast
4,null,null,And the Cabby
5,null,null,who was now standing beside the children
6,null,null,said
7,null,null,"  Strike me pink
8,null,null,I always did say that ' oss ' ad a lot of sense
9,null,null,though .  "
2464 13
 (12, 13),
1,null,null,A Panther
2,null,null,which had been washing its face
3,null,null,stopped for a moment to say
4,null,null,"  Well
5,null,null,if they are
6,null,null,theyre nothing like so good as the first one
7,null,null,At least
8,null,null,1 dont see anything very funny about them
9,null,null,It yawned and went on with its wash
10,null,null,please
11,null,null,"   said Digory
12,fear,in such a hurry,"  im in such a hurry
13,null,null,I want to see the Lion .  "
2465 7
 (6, 1),
1,null,null,You abuelito is dead
2,null,null,Papa says early one morning in my room
3,null,null,Esta muerto
4,null,null,and then as if he just heard the news himself
5,null,null,crumples like a coat and cries
6,sadness,cries,my brave Papa cries
7,null,null,I have never seen my Papa cry and dont know what to do .
2466 6
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,sadness,ashamed,I was immediately ashamed of myself for my vanity
2,null,null,for having assumed that he wanted me to stay with him forever so that he could indulge my whims till the end of time
3,null,null,"  im sorry
4,null,null,"   I said
5,null,null,"  That was a little arrogant
6,null,null,wasnt it
2467 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,We walked over to his neighbor 's compound together
2,null,null,It was a considerable distance and we had to walk on the busy main road for a while
3,null,null,i 'd been in Bali almost four months
4,null,null,and had never seen Ketut leave his compound before

3,null,null,The mantras Ketut chanted to the baby were so sweet
4,null,null,sounding like a combination of the sacred and the affectionate

6,null,null,right above the magic drawing which encompassed the whole universe
7,null,null,and then they touched her soles to the earth for the first time
8,null,null,When they lifted her back up into the air
9,null,null,tiny damp footprints remained on the ground below her
10,null,null,orienting this child at last onto the great Balinese grid

3,null,null,Bedroll 's big enough

5,null,null,It was big enough
6,null,null,warm enough
7,null,null,and in a little while they deepened their intimacy considerably .

5,null,null,quit if he had to
6,null,null,and go into the mountains at short notice .
2733 2
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,remembered,What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close
2,null,null,the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger .
2734 6
 (1, 6),
1,sadness,The huge sadness,The huge sadness of the northern plains rolled down on him
2,null,null,He didnt know which way it was
3,null,null,the tire iron or a real accident
4,null,null,blood choking down Jack 's throat and nobody to turn him over
5,null,null,Under the wind drone he heard steel slamming off bone
6,null,null,the hollow chatter of a settling tire rim .
2735 7
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,He had been about three or four
2,null,null,he said
3,null,null,always late getting to the toilet

2,null,null,Jack as he had first seen him
3,null,null,curly headed and smiling and bucktoothed
4,null,null,talking about getting up off his pockets and into the control zone
5,null,null,but the can of beans with the spoon handle jutting out and balanced on the log was there as well
6,null,null,in a cartoon shape and lurid colors that gave the dreams a flavor of comic obscenity
7,null,null,The spoon handle was the kind that could be used as a tire iron
8,null,null,And he would wake sometimes in grief
9,happiness,release,sometimes with the old sense of joy and release
10,null,null,the pillow sometimes wet
11,null,null,sometimes the sheets .

 (9, 12),

8,null,null,insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower
9,disgust,hates,I le hates me
10,null,null,Or at least distrusts me
11,null,null,Even though it was years ago
12,null,null,I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home .

2,null,null,belly swollen with worms
3,null,null,crawling with fleas
4,null,null,The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed
5,null,null,But Prim begged so hard
6,sadness,cried,cried even
7,null,null,I had to let him stay
8,null,null,It turned out okay
9,null,null,My mother got rid ofthe vermin and he 's a born mouser
10,null,null,Even catches the occasional rat
11,null,null,Sometimes
12,null,null,when I clean a kill
13,null,null,I feed Buttercup the entrails

 (10, 10),(10, 11),
1,null,null,Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam
2,null,null,I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow
3,null,null,Separating the Meadow from the woods
4,null,null,in fact enclosing all of District 12
5,null,null,is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire loops
6,null,null,In theory
7,null,null,it 's supposed to be electrified twenty four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods  !  packs of wild dogs
8,null,null,lone cougars
9,null,null,bears  !  that used to threaten our streets
10,happiness,lucky,But since we 're lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings
11,null,null,it 's usually safe to touch
12,null,null,Even so
13,null,null,I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live
14,null,null,Right now
15,null,null,it 's silent as a stone
16,null,null,Concealed by a clump of bushes
17,null,null,I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that 's been loose for years
18,null,null,There are several other weak spots in the fence
19,null,null,but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here .
2741 14
 (6, 6),(6, 7),(6, 8),
1,null,null,As soon as im in the trees
2,null,null,I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log
3,null,null,Electrified or not
4,null,null,the fence  has been successful at keeping the flesh eaters out of District 12
5,null,null,Inside the woods they roam freely
6,fear,added concerns,and there are added concerns like venomous snakes
7,null,null,rabid animals
8,null,null,and no real paths to follow
9,null,null,But there 's also food if you know how to find it
10,null,null,My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion
11,null,null,There was nothing even to bury
12,null,null,I was eleven then
13,null,null,Five years later
14,null,null,I still wake up screaming for him to run .
2742 6
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poach ing carries the severest of penalties
2,fear,risk,more people would risk it if they had weapons
3,null,null,But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife
4,null,null,My bow is a rarity
5,null,null,crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods
6,null,null,carefully wrapped in waterproof covers .
2743 7
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,When I was younger
2,fear,scared,I scared my mother to death
3,null,null,the things I would blurt out about District 12
4,null,null,about the people who rule our country
5,null,null,Panem
6,null,null,from the far-off city called the Capitol
7,null,null,Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble .
2744 8
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself
2,null,null,Gale
3,happiness,relaxing,I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing
4,null,null,my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place
5,null,null,a rock ledge overlooking a valley
6,null,null,A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes
7,null,null,The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile
8,null,null,Gale says I never smile except in the woods .
2746 12
 (11, 10),
1,null,null,"  Hey
2,null,null,Catnip
3,null,null,"   says Gale
4,null,null,My real name is Katniss
5,null,null,but when I first told him
6,null,null,I had barely whispered it
7,null,null,So he thought i 'd said Catnip
8,null,null,Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts
9,null,null,it became his official nickname for me
10,null,null,I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game
11,sadness,regretted,I almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company
12,null,null,But I got a decent price for his pelt .
2747 11
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  Look what I shot
2,null,null,"   Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it
3,happiness,laugh,and I laugh
4,null,null,It 's real bakery bread
5,null,null,not the flat
6,null,null,dense loaves we make from our grain rations
7,null,null,I take it in my hands
8,null,null,pull out the arrow
9,null,null,and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose
10,null,null,inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva
11,null,null,Fine bread like this is for special occasions .
2748 9
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Besides
2,null,null,if he wants kids
3,null,null,Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife
4,null,null,He 's good-looking
5,null,null,he 's strong enough to handle the work in the mines
6,null,null,and he can hunt
7,null,null,You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him
8,disgust,jealous,It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think
9,null,null,Good hunting partners are hard to find .
2749 8
 (3, 5),
1,null,null,Tonight
2,null,null,After the reaping
3,happiness,celebrate,everyone is supposed to celebrate
4,null,null,And a lot of people do
5,null,null,out of relief that their children have been spared for another year
6,null,null,But at least two families will pull their shutters
7,null,null,lock their doors
8,null,null,and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come .
2751 10
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,"  And nothing like myself
2,null,null,"   I say
3,null,null,I hug her
4,null,null,because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her
5,null,null,Her first reaping
6,null,null,She 's about as safe as you can get
7,null,null,since she 's only entered once
8,null,null,I would n't let her take out any tesserae
9,fear,worried,But she 's worried about me
10,null,null,That the unthinkable might happen .
2752 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I protect Prim in every way I can
2,null,null,but im powerless against the reaping
3,sadness,anguish,The anguish I always feel when she 's in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ( ace
4,null,null,I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm
5,null,null,"  Tuck your tail in
6,null,null,little duck
7,null,null,"   I say
8,null,null,smoothing the blouse back in place .
2753 7
 (7, 1),
1,null,null,Prim giggles and gives me a small  "  Quack
2,null,null,Quack yourself
3,null,null,"   I say with a light laugh
4,null,null,The kind only Prim can draw out of me
5,null,null,"  Come on
6,null,null,let 's eat
7,happiness,plant,"   I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head .
2756 9
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,Through the crowd
2,null,null,I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile
3,null,null,As reaping s go
4,happiness,entertainment,this one at least has a slight entertainment factor
5,null,null,But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor
6,null,null,Not compared to a lot of the boys
7,null,null,And maybe he 's thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away
8,null,null,"  But there are still thousands of slips
9,null,null,"   I wish I could whisper to him .
2757 11
 (8, 1),
1,null,null,It 's time for the drawing
2,null,null,Effie Trinket says as she always does
3,null,null,"  Ladies first
4,null,null,"   and crosses to the glass ball with the girls ' names
5,null,null,She reaches in
6,null,null,digs her hand deep into the ball
7,null,null,and pulls out a slip of paper
8,fear,collective breath,The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop
9,null,null,and im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it 's not me
10,null,null,that it 's not me
11,null,null,that it 's not me .

1,null,null,Somewhere far away
2,sadness,un happily,I can hear the crowd murmuring un happily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair
3,null,null,And then I see her
4,null,null,the blood drained from her face
5,null,null,hands clenched in fists at her sides
6,null,null,walking with stiff
7,null,null,small steps up toward the stage
8,null,null,passing me
9,null,null,and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt
10,null,null,It 's this detail
11,null,null,the untucked blouse forming a ducktail
12,null,null,that brings me back to myself .

 (1, 3),
1,happiness,Lovely,"  Lovely
2,null,null,"   says Effie Trinket
3,null,null,"  But I believe there 's a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers

6,happiness,more excitement,"  But more excitement to come
7,null,null,It 's time to choose our boy tribute
8,null,null,"   Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation
9,null,null,she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys ' names and grabs the first slip she encounters
10,null,null,She zips back to the podium
11,null,null,and I dont even have time to wish for Gale 's safety when she 's reading the name

 (7, 8),
1,null,null,All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12

2,disgust,sick,telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash
3,null,null,The words were ugly and I had no defense

5,null,null,I noticed him
