19,null,null,a little incident that occurred after your return .
436 13
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,Contrary to his usual custom
2,null,null,he took the little staircase on the right
3,null,null,leading to the grand vestibule
4,null,null,where several lawyers were assembled
5,null,null,earnestly engaged in conversation
6,null,null,They were evidently astonished to see Pascal
7,null,null,and their conversation abruptly ceased on his approach
8,null,null,They assumed a grave look and turned away their heads in disgust
9,null,null,The unfortunate man at once realized the truth
10,null,null,and pressed his hand to his forehead
11,sadness,despairing,with a despairing gesture
12,null,null,as he murmured :   "  Already

2,null,null,and in a tone of profound discouragement
3,null,null,he replied :   "  But what can I do
4,null,null,How can I escape from the web which has been woven around me with such fiendish cunning
5,null,null,If I had possessed my usual presence of mind at the moment of the accusation
6,null,null,I might have defended and justified myself
7,null,null,perhaps
8,null,null,But now the misfortune is irreparable
9,null,null,How can I unmask the traitor
10,null,null,and what proofs of his guilt can I cast in his face
450 22
 (9, 4),
1,null,null,That was
2,null,null,indeed
3,null,null,what he desired
4,null,null,With the hand that was comparatively free
5,null,null,with the hoarse rattle that was his only voice
6,null,null,de Chalusse answered
7,null,null,"  Yes
8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,with an expression of joy and gratitude,"   and his eyes even turned to Madame Leon with an expression of joy and gratitude
10,null,null,They raised him on his pillows
11,null,null,and brought him a small writing - desk
12,null,null,with some paper
13,null,null,and a pen that had been dipped in ink
14,null,null,But like those around him
15,null,null,he had himself over estimated his strength
16,null,null,if he could move his hand
17,null,null,he could not CONTROL its movements
18,null,null,After a terrible effort and intense suffering
19,null,null,however
20,null,null,he succeeded in tracing a few words
21,null,null,the meaning of which it was impossible to understand
22,null,null,It was only with the greatest difficulty that these words could be deciphered  "  My entire fortune give friends against   "   This signified nothing .

9,null,null,It was a mania with him
10,null,null,If he had a letter to write
11,null,null,he barricaded his door
12,null,null,as if he were about to commit some horrible crime
13,null,null,More than once have I seen him   "   The words died away on her lips
14,null,null,and she remained motionless and abashed
15,null,null,like a person who has just escaped some great peril
16,null,null,One word more
17,null,null,and involuntarily
18,null,null,without even knowing it
19,null,null,she would have confessed her besetting sin
20,null,null,which was listening at
21,null,null,and peering through
22,null,null,the keyholes of the doors that were closed against her .
463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,null,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
468 18
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Her cheeks were crimson now
2,null,null,her eyes were lowered
3,null,null,and she was evidently embarrassed
4,null,null,But suddenly
5,null,null,as if ashamed of her blushes
6,null,null,she proudly raised her head
7,null,null,and said
8,null,null,in a firmer voice :   "  Shall I tell you our simple story
9,null,null,Is it necessary
10,null,null,I should not have concealed anything that has passed from my mother
11,happiness,happy,if I had been so happy as to possess a mother
12,null,null,A few moments ' conversation now and then
13,null,null,the exchange of a few letters
14,null,null,the pressure of a hand through the garden gate
15,null,null,and that is all
16,null,null,Still
17,null,null,I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault :  I have disobeyed the one rule of my life frankness
18,null,null,and I am cruelly punished for doing so .
470 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,surprise,frightened,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,null,null,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .

2,null,null,he served passably well
3,null,null,but he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count
4,null,null,He scented some great family secret in the household
5,anger,angry and humiliated,and he felt angry and humiliated that this secret had not been entrusted to his discretion
6,null,null,And if he had discovered nothing
7,null,null,it was because M
8,null,null,de Chalusse had been caution personified

2,null,null,he talked with inexcusable freedom of the Count de Chalusse
3,null,null,and M

5,null,null,and especially of his enemy
6,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,"  For it is she

10,null,null,How she did it
11,null,null,no one will ever know
12,null,null,for she has not an equal in craftiness
13,null,null,but it 's she who has stolen them
14,null,null,im sure of it
15,null,null,I would have taken my oath to that effect before the magistrate
16,null,null,and I would have proved it
17,null,null,too

1,null,null,Once more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark :   "  There it is again sufficient to live upon

1,null,null,Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars
2,null,null,the butler
3,null,null,was in there
4,null,null,packing her things too
5,sadness,sighed,She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase
6,null,null,followed by Bruno
7,null,null,who wasnt going to let the matter drop without an explanation .
510 12
 (9, 1),
1,null,null,' say goodbye to them
2,null,null,' he asked
3,null,null,staring at her in surprise
4,null,null,' say goodbye to them
5,null,null,' he repeated
6,null,null,spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he 'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet
7,null,null,' say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin
8,null,null,' he continued
9,anger,shouting,his voice coming dangerously close to shouting

530 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,' look over there

3,null,null,and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw
4,null,null,emerging from a hut in the distance
5,fear,huddled,a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers
6,null,null,The more they were shouted at
7,null,null,the closer they huddled together
8,null,null,but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along
9,null,null,which was to stand in a single line
10,null,null,When they did
11,null,null,the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them .
535 8
 (5, 1),
1,null,null,' you were a help to your mother and sister in closing the house
2,null,null,yes
3,null,null,Father

 (4, 6),
1,null,null,' did you do something bad in work

4,happiness,laughed,Father laughed
5,null,null,which upset Bruno even more
6,null,null,there was nothing that made him more angry than when a grown-up laughed at him for not knowing something
7,null,null,especially when he was trying to find out the answer by asking questions .

 (5, 1),(5, 3),
1,null,null,' go to your room
2,null,null,Bruno
3,null,null,' he said in such a quiet voice that Bruno knew that he meant business now
4,null,null,so he stood up
5,sadness,tears,tears of frustration forming in his eyes
6,null,null,He walked towards the door
7,null,null,but before opening it he turned round and asked one final question
8,null,null,' father
9,null,null,' he began .
559 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,' when I make mistakes I get punished
2,null,null,' insisted Bruno
3,anger,irritated,irritated by the fact that the rules that always applied to children never seemed to apply to grownups at all ( despite the fact that they were the ones who enforced them )
4,null,null,' stupid Father
5,null,null,' he added under his breath .
573 11
 (10, 6),
1,null,null,' no

4,null,null,' just keep quiet about it
5,null,null,Bruno
6,null,null,dont you know how much trouble you could cause
7,null,null,For all of us
8,null,null,' Bruno stared at her
9,null,null,There was something in her eyes
10,anger,frenzied,a sort of frenzied worry
11,null,null,that he had never seen there before and that unsettled him .
583 12
 (9, 12),
1,null,null,' stop it

7,null,null,' oh

10,null,null,staring at his sister in irritation
11,null,null,It was bad enough having to come out here and ask for a favour from Lieutenant Kotler
12,null,null,but it only  made things worse when his own sister teased him all the way through it .
595 11
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,On Christmas Day Father wore his brand-new uniform
2,null,null,the starched and pressed one that he wore every day now
3,happiness,applauded,and the whole family applauded when he first appeared in it
4,null,null,It really was something special
5,null,null,Compared to the other soldiers who came in and out of the house
6,null,null,he stood out
7,null,null,and they seemed to respect him all the more now that he had it
8,null,null,Mother went up to him and kissed him on the cheek and ran a hand across the front of it
9,null,null,commenting on how fine she thought the fabric was
10,null,null,Bruno was particularly impressed by all the decorations on the uniform and he had been allowed to wear the cap for a short period
11,null,null,provided his hands were clean when he put it on .
603 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,He stared at the boy and considered asking him why he looked so sad but hesitated because he thought it might sound rude
2,fear,sad,He knew that sometimes people who were sad didnt want to be asked about it
3,null,null,sometimes they 'd offer the information themselves and sometimes they would n't stop talking about it for months on end
4,null,null,but on this occasion Bruno thought that he should wait before saying anything
5,null,null,He had discovered something during his exploration
6,null,null,and now that he was finally talking to one of the people on the other side of the fence it seemed like a good idea to make the most of the opportunity .
606 11
 (8, 1),(8, 4),
1,null,null,' do you have many friends
2,null,null,' asked Bruno
3,null,null,cocking his head a little to the side as he waited for an answer

1,null,null,Bruno had the shampoo as well

3,null,null,which  made Bruno cry
4,disgust,hated,It didnt take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet
5,null,null,but Father said it had to be done .

 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Nothing at all changed for a few weeks
2,null,null,life went on as normal

4,null,null,Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps
5,null,null,some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch
6,fear,worried,and Bruno was worried for her health because he 'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries

8,null,null,( Herr Liszt was particularly pleased with her for doing this .  )

2,null,null,As he continued his prayer she felt all her old terror return
3,null,null,that terror that she had known on the night her father died
4,null,null,during the hours that she had watched beside his dead body
5,null,null,at the moment when she had first arrived at the house in London
6,null,null,during her first visit to the Chapel

1,null,null,Marguerite at once understood that as Madame Leon knew that the marquis was among the funeral guests
2,null,null,she had gone to warn him of Madame de Fondege 's presence
3,null,null,This trivial circumstance proved that Mde Fondege 's interests were opposed to those of Mde Valorsay

5,null,null,Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man
6,null,null,The rhinoceros fights with the elephant
7,null,null,and transfixing him with his horn carries him off upon his head
8,null,null,but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy
9,null,null,he falls helpless to the ground
10,null,null,and then comes the roc
11,null,null,and clutches them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young
12,null,null,This doubtless astonishes you
13,null,null,but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself
14,fear,fear,For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful things which we saw in this island
15,null,null,Before we left I exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited greatly on our homeward way
16,null,null,At last we reached Balsora
17,null,null,whence I hastened to Bagdad
18,null,null,where my first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor

2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person
10,null,null,not obstreperously so
11,null,null,but quietly and under the surface
12,null,null,Business was a great urge
13,null,null,He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars

26,null,null,undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her
27,null,null,There was no will
28,null,null,but in the final adjustment
29,null,null,which included the sale of the shoe business
30,null,null,there being no desire on anybody 's part to contest her right to all the property
31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house
33,null,null,and was considered a charming and interesting widow .
847 13
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The pages dreaded their master 's wrath
2,null,null,departed for a while
3,sadness,sorry,and then sent another lad to tell me he was sorry to hear I felt unwell
4,null,null,but he hoped I would come if only for a minute
5,null,null,bringing my medicines with me
6,null,null,for he himself felt pain
7,null,null,That this second message was a forged one I had no doubt
8,null,null,for the boys had not been long enough gone
9,null,null,still
10,null,null,I packed up my medicines and went
11,null,null,leaving the onus
12,null,null,should any accident happen
13,null,null,upon the mischievous story bearers .
848 7
 (5, 5),

1,null,null,She could not pretend that she was sorry that her father had died
2,sadness,missed,and yet she missed him because she knew very well that she was now no one 's business
3,null,null,that she was utterly and absolutely alone in the universe

5,null,null,but

 (2, 5),
1,null,null,Her lips quivered
2,sadness,was near tears,again she was near tears
3,null,null,and again
4,null,null,as it had been on her walk with Uncle Mathew
5,null,null,her regret was not for her father but for the waste that her life with him had been
6,null,null,But there was something in her aunt that prevented complete confidence .
889 6

2,null,null,through the kitchen garden at the back of the village
3,null,null,down the hill by the village street
4,null,null,over the little bridge that crossed the rocky stream of the Dreot
5,null,null,and up the steep hill that led on to the outskirts of Rothin Moor
6,null,null,The day
7,null,null,although she had no eyes for it
8,surprise,surprise,was one of those sudden impulses of misty warmth that surprise the Glebeshire frosts
9,null,null,The long stretch of the moor was enwrapped by a thin silver network of haze
10,null,null,the warmth of the sun
11,null,null,seen so dimly that it was like a shadow reflected in a mirror
12,null,null,struck to the very heart of the soil .

1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,it 's bad luck
3,null,null,"   she cried
4,sadness,distress fully,staring distress fully at the old man
5,null,null,He smiled
6,null,null,and would have certainly been very agreeable to her had not Aunt Anne

2,null,null,Anyway
3,null,null,why not
4,null,null,perfectly right

4,null,null,you 've got an influence over me
5,sadness,ashamed,you 've made me ashamed of things I would n't have hesitated about a year ago

1,null,null,She had already learned that the Butlers were rather showy the younger generation that they were sensitive as to their lineage
2,null,null,and that money in their estimation was supposed to make up for any deficiency in any other respect
3,null,null,"  Butler himself is a very presentable man

1250 25
 (25, 25),
1,null,null,Cowperwood knew that there were such properties
2,null,null,His very alert mind had long since sensed the general opportunities here
3,null,null,The omnibuses were slowly disappearing
4,null,null,The best routes were already preempted
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,there were other streets
7,null,null,and the city was growing

9,null,null,One could afford to pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait and extend the lines into larger and better areas later
10,null,null,And already he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the  "  endless chain
11,null,null,"   or  "  agreeable formula
12,null,null,"   as it was later termed
13,null,null,of buying a certain property on a long-time payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient not only to pay your seller

15,null,null,to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other things  allied properties

2,null,null,Cowperwood was a financier
3,null,null,Instead of dwelling on the works of nature
4,null,null,its beauty and subtlety
5,null,null,to his material disadvantage
6,null,null,he found a happy mean
7,null,null,owing to the swiftness of his intellectual operations

9,null,null,intellectually and emotionally
10,happiness,rejoice,rejoice in the beauty of life without interfering with his perpetual material and financial calculations
11,null,null,And when it came to women and morals
12,null,null,which involved so much relating to beauty
13,null,null,happiness
14,null,null,a sense of distinction and variety in living
15,null,null,he was but now beginning to suspect for himself at least that apart from maintaining organized society in its present form there was no basis for this one life

 (24, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident

4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then
18,null,null,O Heavens

25,null,null,It made him smile
26,null,null,Such hypocrisy
27,null,null,Such cant
28,null,null,Still
29,null,null,so the world was organized
30,null,null,and it was not for him to set it right
31,null,null,Let it wag as it would
32,null,null,The thing for him to do was to get rich and hold his own to build up a seeming of virtue and dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing
33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit
35,null,null,And he had these
36,null,null,"  I satisfy myself
37,null,null,"   was his motto
38,null,null,and it might well have been emblazoned upon any coat of arms which he could have contrived to set forth his claim to intellectual and social nobility .

1,null,null,At the same time
2,null,null,in contemplating his wife in connection with all this he had many qualms
3,null,null,some emotional
4,null,null,some financial
5,null,null,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
6,null,null,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
7,null,null,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton
8,null,null,And yet
9,null,null,as he had also learned
10,null,null,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
11,null,null,This irritated Cowperwood

13,null,null,acquisitive
14,null,null,direct seeing temperament
15,null,null,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
16,null,null,why should there be concealment between them
17,null,null,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
18,null,null,Why do one thing and think another
19,null,null,To be sure
20,null,null,she was devoted to him in her quiet way
21,null,null,not passionately ( as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that )
22,null,null,but intellectually
23,null,null,Duty
24,null,null,as she understood it
25,null,null,played a great part in this .

2,null,null,without turning
3,null,null,He came beside her

5,null,null,the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishing  or melting into another mood
6,null,null,Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers
7,null,null,His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch
8,null,null,She stopped playing and tried to catch her breath
9,null,null,for
10,null,null,strong as she was
11,null,null,it affected her breathing
12,null,null,her heart was beating like a trip hammer
13,null,null,She did not say

2,null,null,Butler and Mollenhauer and Simpson were long on local street railways
3,null,null,They must combine to support the situation and protect their interests
4,null,null,They could see the big bankers
5,null,null,Drexel & Co
6,null,null,and Cooke & Co
7,null,null,and others and urge them to sustain the market
8,null,null,They could strengthen things generally by organizing a buying ring
9,null,null,and under cover of their support
10,null,null,if they would
11,null,null,he might sell enough to let him out
12,null,null,and even permit him to go short and make something a whole lot
13,null,null,It was a brilliant thought
14,null,null,worthy of a greater situation
15,null,null,and its only weakness was that it was not absolutely certain of fulfillment .
1319 15
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,They were allied in no one particular financial proposition
2,null,null,any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were
3,null,null,And besides
4,null,null,in all probability Cowperwood was no fool
5,null,null,He was not equally guilty with Stener
6,null,null,the latter had loaned him money
7,null,null,The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues
8,null,null,but he decided not
9,null,null,Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind
10,fear,dangerous,It was a splendid chance but dangerous
11,null,null,He had better go it alone
12,null,null,For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could
13,null,null,If not
14,null,null,Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party

1799 10
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,It is
2,null,null,perhaps

1,null,null,The captain shook hands with me cordially
2,null,null,pooh poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade
3,happiness,delight,but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe
4,null,null,The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats
5,null,null,though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him
6,null,null,that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once
7,null,null,working all night .
1854 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Before we left finally for New Zealand
2,null,null,every one of those Kanakas was as much at home in the whale boats as he would have been in a canoe
3,null,null,Of course they were greatly helped by their entire familiarity with the water
4,fear,dread,which took from them all that dread of being drowned which hampers the white  "  greenie "   so sorely
5,null,null,besides which
6,null,null,the absolute confidence they had in our prowess amongst the whales freed them from any fear on that head .

2,null,null,they saw the heavens bespread with an awful pall of smoke
3,null,null,the underside of which was glowing with the reflected fires of some vast furnace
4,fear,terror,Their terror was increased by a smart shower of falling ashes and the reverberations of subterranean thunders
5,null,null,At first they thought of flight in their boat
6,null,null,not reckoning the wide stretch of sea which rolled between them and the nearest land
7,null,null,but the height and frequency of the breakers then prevailing made that impossible .

1,null,null,Making myself at home with him
2,null,null,I desired to know what brought him so far from the  "  big smoke

4,null,null,the rest of her large crew of over forty all told being made up of Maories and half-breeds
5,null,null,One common interest united them

7,null,null,There was here to be found no jealousy of the Maories being officers and harpooner s
8,null,null,no black looks or discontented murmuring
9,happiness,satisfied,all hands seemed particularly well satisfied with their lot in all its bearings
10,null,null,so that
11,null,null,although the old tub was malodorous enough to turn even a pretty strong stomach
12,null,null,it was a leasure to visit her cheerful crowd for the sake of their enlivening society .

3,null,null,Brougham will be so pleased  and yet it shocked you

6,null,null,and be proud to own them
7,null,null,But I dont care who owns mine
8,null,null,I just want the fun of painting them
9,null,null,Just think of what a man can do with a few tubes of color
10,null,null,a brush
11,null,null,and a bit of canvas
12,null,null,So I dont care if they never buy what I paint
13,null,null,I can get along somehow
