1,null,null,She almost fainted

3,null,null,this happiness proved too much for her

7,null,null,against a disappointment that hammered with a thundering noise
8,null,null,somewhere far away in the recesses of her soul .

 (4, 4),
1,null,null,She had hoped that he would be there
2,null,null,waiting
3,null,null,so that he might have a word with her before they went in
4,sadness,disappointment,but when they were all gathered together under the porch she saw with a throb of disappointment that he was not there
5,null,null,She saw no one whom she knew
6,null,null,but it struck her at once that here was a gathering quite different from that of the first time that she had come to the Chapel .
967 10
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Miss avies ' two friends
2,surprise,surprised,huddled and frightened like fledglings suddenly surprised by a cuckoo
3,null,null,stirred Maggie 's sympathy
4,null,null,She disliked Miss Avies from the very first moment
5,null,null,Miss Avies had a pale
6,null,null,thin
7,null,null,pointed face with no eyebrows
8,null,null,grey eyes dim and short-sighted
9,null,null,and fair colourless hair brushed straight back under a hard
10,null,null,ugly black hat .
969 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She set back her shoulders
2,null,null,sat up stiffly
3,null,null,and tried to look as old as she might  that was not
4,null,null,unhappily
5,null,null,very old
6,happiness,happy,That smile exchanged with Martin had made her happy for ever
7,null,null,Miss Avies was of less than no importance at all

1,happiness,glad,But it 's nothing nothing really only im glad

9,null,null,Ever since our first meeting and it 's partly been my fault .
976 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,I wasnt good at first
2,null,null,I wanted to be kind
3,null,null,but I was stiff and shy
4,null,null,You would n't think that im shy
5,null,null,I am
6,null,null,terribly
7,null,null,I always have been since I was very little
8,sadness,embarrassed,and just to enter a room when other people are there makes me so embarrassed
9,null,null,I remember once when mother was alive her scolding me because I would n't come in to a tea party
10,null,null,But I could n't
11,null,null,I stood outside the door in an agony
12,null,null,doing everything to make myself go in but I could n't
984 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,im queer I have funny moods that last for days and days sometimes
2,null,null,I seem to do every one harm I come in touch with

5,sadness,unhappy,and yet I make him unhappy all the time

7,null,null,really
8,null,null,im not

11,null,null,and that you always will be one of us
12,null,null,That 's why I like you and will be a friend to you too .  "
993 11
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,And this figure
2,null,null,Martin knew
3,null,null,was a prey to every morbid desire
4,null,null,rushed to sensual excess and then crept back miserably to search for some spiritual flagellation
5,null,null,Above all
6,sadness,restless,it was restless
7,null,null,as some one presses round a dark room searching for the lock of the door
8,null,null,restless and lonely
9,null,null,cowardly and selfish
10,null,null,but searching and sensitive and even faithful
11,null,null,faithful to something or to some one

6,null,null,I love you
7,null,null,Martin
8,null,null,so that it 's like hunger or thirst
9,null,null,It 's the only earthly passion that i 've ever had
10,null,null,And i 'll tell you another thing
11,null,null,It 's the one terror of my earthly life that youll leave me
12,null,null,Now that i 've got you back im afraid every time you go out of the house that youll run away
13,null,null,round the corner
14,null,null,and never come back again .

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,helpless,When you remind me of what I was like as a kid I go right back and feel helpless as though you could do anything with me you like
2,null,null,All the same I dont believe in this business
3,null,null,father all this Second Coming and the rest of it .
1013 8
 (5, 3),
1,null,null,She was confident because she did not think
2,null,null,she simply did not think at all

4,null,null,cased in that golden armour
5,happiness,with a sublime and happy confidence,she confronted her aunts and the house and the world behind the house with a sublime and happy confidence
6,null,null,She loved her aunts now
7,null,null,she loved Martha and the parrot and the cat
8,null,null,and she could not believe that they did not all love her .
1036 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her
2,happiness,embarrassed,She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because he seemed glad to see her
3,null,null,He looked the very picture of a well-dressed
4,null,null,kindly
5,null,null,genial friend who had known her all his life
6,null,null,He was wearing a beautifully shining top-hat and his stiff white collar gleamed .
1044 12
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,null,null,She remembered his dark look
2,null,null,his frown when she had refused himOh
3,null,null,this loneliness
4,null,null,this helplessness
5,null,null,If she could be with him
6,null,null,beside him
7,happiness,fear nothing,she would fear nothing
8,null,null,That night
9,null,null,the first faint suspicion of jealousy
10,null,null,of doubt
11,null,null,an agonising dart of pain at the knowledge of what it would mean to her now if he left her
12,null,null,stirred in her breast . This room was stifling
1045 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Aunt Anne 's aloofness was coloured now with a very human anger
2,surprise,surprise,Maggie realised with surprise that she had never seen her angry before
3,null,null,She had been indignant
4,null,null,disapproving
5,null,null,superior
6,null,null,forbidding
7,null,null,but never angry .

6,sadness,disappointed,I am disappointed in you
7,null,null,bitterly disappointed
8,null,null,I saw from the first that you did not mean to care for us
9,null,null,now

3,null,null,try and write every day
4,null,null,even if it 's only the shortest line
5,null,null,because it is dreadful to be shut up all day

4,null,null,You are n't taking any care at all .  "
1062 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,She only saw them all tired and hungry and expectant
2,null,null,perhaps
3,null,null,after all
4,null,null,there WAS something behind it all something for which they had a right to be searching
5,happiness,touched and moved,even of that she had not sure knowledge  but the pathos and also the bravery of their search touched and moved her
6,null,null,She was beginning to understand something of the beauty that hovered like a bird always just out of sight about the ugly walls of the Chapel .
1063 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Only Martin was flesh and blood
2,fear,feared,to be loved and longed for and feared for just as he had always been
3,null,null,All the physical properties of life clothes
4,null,null,food
5,null,null,household possessions
6,null,null,money became of less and less importance to him
7,null,null,Had Amy not watched over him he would have been many days without any food at all
8,null,null,and one day he come into the living-room at breakfast time clothed in a towel .

2,null,null,"   she used to say to herself and feel his elder by at least twenty years
3,sadness,not a happy one,Nevertheless the thought of his struggling on there alone was not a happy one
4,null,null,She longed
5,null,null,even though she might not advise him
6,null,null,to comfort him
7,null,null,She was beginning to realise something of her own power over him and to see
8,null,null,too
9,null,null,the strange mixture of superstition and self reproach and self distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him .
1071 2
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,helplessness,She was now so touched by the pathos of his helplessness that she could think of nothing else and longed to go to him and comfort him
2,null,null,Time stole on and it was now ten minutes to twelve .
1081 10
 (7, 8),
1,null,null,He did indeed seem to lead a mysterious life of his own and paid very little attention to Maggie
2,null,null,asking her once whether she did not think The Golden Ass wonderful
3,null,null,and what did she think of Petronius
4,null,null,and when Maggie laughed and said that she was glad to say she never read anything
5,null,null,he left her in an agitated horror
6,null,null,Lady Rachel Seddon was very grand and splendid
7,fear,frightened,and frightened Katherine
8,null,null,She was related to every kind of duke and marquis
9,null,null,and although that fact did not impress Maggie in the least
10,null,null,it did seem to remove Lady Rachel into quite another world .
1083 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,They could be warm-hearted
2,null,null,it was wonderful to see the way that they all adored Katherine
3,null,null,and they had many friends for whom they would do anything
4,null,null,but the Rev
5,null,null,Paul seemed to them frankly an ass
6,happiness,glad,and they would be glad when he went away .
1086 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,When she was living with the aunts she had not minded very seriously the criticisms made upon her
2,sadness,disappointed,she had indeed been disappointed when Aunt Anne had not admired her new dress
3,null,null,and she had hated Amy Warlock 's rudeness
4,null,null,but that was because Martin had been involved
5,null,null,This new sensitiveness worried her
6,null,null,she hated to care whether people laughed at the way she came into a room or whether she expressed foolish opinions about books and pictures .
1088 7
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,shocked,He was frankly shocked by the Chapel
2,null,null,"  That 's not the way to get into heaven
3,null,null,"   he said

5,null,null,As you know
6,null,null,I have a good stock of the olives which grew in this garden
7,null,null,Now you must take fifty jars

2,null,null,I could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether
3,null,null,My love of trading
4,null,null,and the pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange
5,null,null,made me set my affairs in order
6,null,null,and begin my journey through some of the Persian provinces
7,null,null,having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the different places I intended to visit
8,null,null,I took ship at a distant seaport
9,null,null,and for some time all went well
10,null,null,but at last
11,null,null,being caught in a violent hurricane
12,null,null,our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her
13,null,null,and many of our company perished in the waves
14,null,null,with a few others
15,null,null,had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck
16,null,null,for the storm had driven us near an island
17,null,null,and scrambling up beyond the reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted
18,null,null,to wait for morning .

 (15, 15),
1,null,null,On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and killed it
2,null,null,and handed me a knife
3,null,null,which they said I should by and by find useful
4,null,null,"  We must sew you into this sheep skin
5,null,null,"   said they
6,null,null,"  and then leave you

8,null,null,called a roc
9,null,null,will appear in the air
10,null,null,taking you to be a sheep
11,null,null,He will snatch you up and carry you into the sky
12,null,null,but be not alarmed
13,null,null,for he will bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain
14,null,null,When you are on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throw it off
15,fear,fear,As soon as the roc sees you he will fly away from fear
16,null,null,but you must walk on till you come to a castle covered with plates of gold
17,null,null,studded with jewels
18,null,null,Enter boldly at the gate
19,null,null,which always stands open
20,null,null,but do not ask us to tell you what we saw or what befel us there
21,null,null,for that you will learn for yourself
22,null,null,This only we may say
23,null,null,that it cost us each our right eye
24,null,null,and has imposed upon us our nightly penance .  "

5,null,null,laid him in his place
6,null,null,and transported the bed back to the palace .

5,null,null,"  you have n't grown an inch
6,null,null,I thought when you married old brother Hy here that you were going to fatten up like your brother
7,null,null,But look at you
8,null,null,I swear to Heaven you dont weigh five pounds
9,null,null,And he jounced her up and down by the waist
10,null,null,much to the perturbation of the children

2,null,null,genial smile
3,null,null,He was feeling very comfortable under this evidence of approval
4,null,null,He looked bright and cheery in his well-made clothes of English tweed .

 (4, 7),(4, 9),
1,null,null,On the way home that evening he speculated as to the nature of this business

4,happiness,grateful,They were grateful
5,null,null,of course
6,null,null,but why should n't they be
7,null,null,He was efficient
8,null,null,he knew that
9,null,null,under him things moved smoothly
10,null,null,It never occurred to him that he belonged in the realm of clerkdom .

 (8, 8),
1,null,null,There was great talk concerning morality
2,null,null,much praise of virtue and decency
3,null,null,and much lifting of hands in righteous horror at people who broke or were even rumored to have broken the Seventh Commandment

1,null,null,At first
2,null,null,when Frank called
3,null,null,she did not have much to say
4,null,null,She was gracious
5,null,null,but the burden of conversation fell on her husband
6,null,null,Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time
7,null,null,and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something
8,null,null,Fortunately she was not
9,null,null,Semple talked to him pleasantly
10,null,null,because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant
11,null,null,was suave and ingratiating
12,happiness,anxious,and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line

7,null,null,she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms
8,null,null,They were very pretty
9,null,null,A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long
10,null,null,peculiarly shaded hair
11,null,null,She thought of young Cowperwood
12,sadness,shamed,and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr
13,null,null,Semple and the force and quality of public opinion .

 (13, 13),
1,null,null,And Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood

8,null,null,Her voice had the subtle
9,null,null,vigorous ring of fifteen or sixteen

5,null,null,but it sufficed
6,null,null,and for the first time that voyage I had the privilege of  "  raising "   a sperm whale
7,happiness,excitement,My voice quivered with excitement as I uttered the war whoop

1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,null,null,and the three hundred fathoms of line
3,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
4,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
5,happiness,Happily,Happily
6,null,null,there were two boats disengaged

5,null,null,islets
6,null,null,and dangerous currents with which it abounds .
1791 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Doubtless because he himself was much fatigued

5,null,null,But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water

4,null,null,or until all was shipshape again
5,null,null,Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo
6,null,null,never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business .

5,null,null,and reunited the dismembered realm of Denmark into its original shape
6,null,null,Then he found that Asmund

9,null,null,and
