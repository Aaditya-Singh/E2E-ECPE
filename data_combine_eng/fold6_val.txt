2,null,null,her father
3,null,null,has carefully shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze
4,null,null,and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband
5,null,null,But in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before
6,null,null,The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal
7,null,null,the second of bronze
8,null,null,the third of fine steel
9,null,null,the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze
10,null,null,the fifth of touchstone

13,null,null,They are all most sumptuously furnished
14,null,null,whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste
15,null,null,In fact
16,null,null,neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess
17,null,null,The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide
18,null,null,and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage
19,null,null,The king has always received these embassies graciously
20,null,null,but says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will
21,null,null,and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal

2,null,null,and bade me farewell
3,null,null,and I set out with my new companions
4,null,null,I soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts
5,null,null,but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks
6,null,null,I did not at all understand how we were to do it
7,null,null,The crowns of the cocoa palms were all alive with monkeys
8,null,null,big and little
9,null,null,which skipped from one to the other with surprising agility
10,null,null,seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance
11,null,null,and I was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures
12,null,null,which seemed to me quite harmless

1,null,null,In this progress of his father young Cowperwood definitely shared
2,null,null,He was quite often allowed to come to the bank on Saturdays

6,null,null,what the men did with all the money they received
7,null,null,His father
8,happiness,pleased,pleased at his interest
9,null,null,was glad to explain so that even at this early age from ten to fifteen the boy gained a wide knowledge of the condition of the country financially what a State bank was and what a national one
10,null,null,what brokers did
11,null,null,what stocks were
12,null,null,and why they fluctuated in value .

1,null,null,He could not think of her reasonably
2,null,null,and he did not talk of her much to any one
3,null,null,His family knew that he went to see her
4,happiness,a deep respect,but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family a deep respect for the mental force of Frank
5,null,null,He was genial
6,null,null,cheerful
7,null,null,gay at most times
8,null,null,without being talkative
9,null,null,and he was decidedly successful
10,null,null,Everybody knew he was making money now
11,null,null,His salary was fifty dollars a week
12,null,null,and he was certain soon to get more .
1209 6
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,She relapsed into additional protests
2,null,null,but he kissed her the more
3,null,null,There was a deadly persuasion to his caresses
4,null,null,Semple had never displayed any such fire
5,null,null,He aroused a force of feeling in her which had not previously been there
6,sadness,ashamed,She was afraid of it and ashamed .

3,null,null,the danger of disease and delivery
4,null,null,He had gone through a real period of strain when Frank

8,null,null,Cowperwood was frightened
9,fear,feared,He feared for the beauty of her body troubled over the danger of losing her

11,null,null,Not much he was too self sufficient
12,null,null,too resourceful
13,null,null,and yet he worried
14,null,null,conjuring up thoughts of death and the end of their present state .
1235 25
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Sympathy and affection were great things
2,null,null,but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss
3,null,null,So often now he saw young girls who were quite in his mood
4,happiness,joyous,and who were exceedingly robust and joyous
5,null,null,It was fine
6,null,null,advisable
7,null,null,practical
8,null,null,to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon
9,null,null,but if you had a sickly wife  And anyhow
10,null,null,was a man entitled to only one wife
11,null,null,Must he never look at another woman
12,null,null,Supposing he found some one
13,null,null,He pondered those things between hours of labor
14,null,null,and concluded that it did not make so much difference
15,null,null,If a man could
16,null,null,and not be exposed
17,null,null,it was all right
18,null,null,He had to be careful
19,null,null,though
20,null,null,Tonight
21,null,null,as he sat on the side of his wife 's bed
22,null,null,he was thinking somewhat of this
23,null,null,for he had seen Aileen Butler again
24,null,null,playing and singing at her piano as he passed the parlor door
25,null,null,She was like a bright bird radiating health and enthusiasm a reminder of youth in general .
1239 21

1,null,null,He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes
2,null,null,though he knew them to be trying to many
3,null,null,Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly
4,null,null,but
5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him
8,null,null,So he had gone his way day by day
9,null,null,watching the coming in and the departing of troops
10,null,null,seeing the bands of dirty
11,null,null,disheveled
12,null,null,gaunt
13,null,null,sickly men returning from the fields and hospitals
14,null,null,and all he could do was to feel sorry
15,null,null,This war was not for him
16,null,null,He had taken no part in it
17,null,null,and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in its conclusion not as a patriot
18,null,null,but as a financier
19,sadness,wasteful,It was wasteful

21,null,null,unfortunate .

6,null,null,He noted the change and smiled
7,happiness,lovely,It was lovely to be dancing with her
8,null,null,He had not thought mere dancing could hold such charm .
1279 38
 (26, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident
3,null,null,in so many ways
4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then

28,null,null,Still
29,null,null,so the world was organized
30,null,null,and it was not for him to set it right
31,null,null,Let it wag as it would
32,null,null,The thing for him to do was to get rich and hold his own to build up a seeming of virtue and dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing
33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit
35,null,null,And he had these
36,null,null,"  I satisfy myself
37,null,null,"   was his motto
38,null,null,and it might well have been emblazoned upon any coat of arms which he could have contrived to set forth his claim to intellectual and social nobility .

1,happiness,intoxicated,This intoxicated him
2,null,null,for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long contemplated dream that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line
3,null,null,issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public
4,null,null,using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way
5,null,null,In short
6,null,null,he was one of those early
7,null,null,daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement .
1308 13
 (13, 12),
1,null,null,However
2,null,null,by the spring and summer of 1871
3,null,null,Cowperwood had actually
4,null,null,without being in any conceivable danger from any source
5,null,null,spread himself out very thin
6,null,null,Because of his great success he had grown more liberal easier in his financial ventures
7,null,null,By degrees
8,null,null,and largely because of his own confidence in himself
9,null,null,he had induced his father to enter upon his street car speculations
10,null,null,to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary
11,null,null,In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical
12,null,null,but as time had worn on and nothing but profit eventuated
13,happiness,more confident,he grew bolder and more confident .
1318 15
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,They were allied in no one particular financial proposition
2,null,null,any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were
3,null,null,And besides
4,null,null,in all probability Cowperwood was no fool
5,null,null,He was not equally guilty with Stener
6,null,null,the latter had loaned him money
7,null,null,The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues
8,null,null,but he decided not
9,null,null,Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind
10,happiness,splendid,It was a splendid chance but dangerous
11,null,null,He had better go it alone
12,null,null,For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could
13,null,null,If not
14,null,null,Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party
15,null,null,if need be .

1,null,null,Stener
2,null,null,as he saw him now

4,null,null,and despite Mr

6,null,null,Simpson and Mr
7,null,null,Butler he proposed to attempt to keep him in his own hands if possible
8,null,null,And so he stood there looking at him as might a snake at a bird determined to galvanize him into selfish self interest if possible
9,fear,so frightened,But Stener was so frightened that at the moment it looked as though there was little to be done with him
10,null,null,His face was a grayish blue :  his eyelids and eye rings puffy and his hands and lips moist
11,null,null,God

3,null,null,for darkened over them their last night
4,happiness,joyed,Within the horse the Argives joyed to hear The uproar of Troy 's feasters setting at naught Cassandra

5,happiness,pleased,which he pleased himself with
6,null,null,to think that they do look upon him as a thriving man
7,null,null,and said so openly at table .
1690 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then in the Quire at the high altar
2,null,null,the King passed through all the ceremonies of the Coronation
3,sadness,grief,which to my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not see The crowne being put upon his head
4,null,null,a great shout begun
5,null,null,and he come forth to the throne
6,null,null,and there passed through more ceremonies .
1692 5
 (1, 1),
1,fear,afraid,So that I was afraid the other would have too great a conquest over them Then to the Wardrobe
2,null,null,and dined there
3,null,null,and then abroad and in Cheapside hear that the Spanish hath got the best of it
4,null,null,and killed three of the French coach horses and several men
5,null,null,and is gone through the City next to our King 's coach .
1716 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,For these Still were insatiate for the bitter fray
2,happiness,longed,Still longed for turmoil of the fight
3,null,null,They bade Their own folk bear against that giant wall What things whatsoever for war 's assaults avail
4,null,null,In hope to lay that stately fortress low .
1723 9
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,For the first quarter of an hour
2,null,null,in spite of the September chill
3,null,null,the sweat poured off me in streams
4,null,null,And the course well
5,null,null,if was not steering
6,null,null,it was sculling
7,null,null,the old bumboat was wobbling all around like a drunken tailor with two left legs
8,sadness,apprehension,I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass
9,null,null,I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way .
1727 10
 (5, 6),(5, 7),(5, 8),
1,null,null,We were all gathered about the folk ' sle scuttle one evening
2,null,null,a few days after the gale referred to in the previous chapter
3,null,null,and the question of whale fishing came up for discussion
4,null,null,Until that time
5,surprise,strange,strange as it may seem
6,null,null,no word of this
7,null,null,the central idea of all our minds
8,null,null,had been mooted
9,null,null,ery man seemed to shun the subject
10,null,null,although we were in daily expectation of being called upon to take an active part in whale fighting .
1737 6
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,but as we secured five of them
2,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
3,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
4,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
5,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
6,null,null,they were so lively .
1739 7
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done
2,sadness,pity,It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo
3,null,null,and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee
4,null,null,Next day
5,null,null,and for a whole week after
6,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
7,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner .  "
1749 15
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,You WANT somethin' to growl about
2,null,null,you do
3,null,null,"   Well
4,null,null,Cap'n George
5,null,null,"   said one of the men
6,null,null,"  you shorely dont think we k'n eat shells
7,null,null,do yer
8,null,null,"   Just then I caught sight of the kid 's contents
9,anger,indignation,and could hardly restrain my indignation
10,null,null,For in a dirty heap
11,null,null,the sight of which might have pleased an Esquimaux
12,null,null,but was certainly enough to disgust any civilized man
13,null,null,lay the calipee
14,null,null,or under shell of the turtle
15,null,null,hacked into irregular blocks .
1767 18
 (11, 12),
1,null,null,None of your high art here
2,null,null,but haul in hand over hand
3,null,null,the line being strong enough to land a 250 pound fish
4,null,null,Up he came
5,null,null,the beauty
6,null,null,all silver and scarlet and blue
7,null,null,five feet long if an inch
8,null,null,and weighing 35 pounds
9,null,null,Well
10,null,null,such a lot of astonished men I never saw
11,surprise,hardly believe their eyes,They could hardly believe their eyes
12,null,null,That such a daring innovation should be successful was hardly to be believed
13,null,null,even with the vigorous evidence before them
14,null,null,Even grim Captain Slocum came to look and turned upon me as I thought a less lowering brow than usual
15,null,null,while Mr
16,null,null,Count
17,null,null,the mate
18,null,null,fairly chuckled again at the thought of how the little Britisher had wiped the eyes of these veteran fishermen .
1774 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
2,null,null,having been absent only two hours
3,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals
4,null,null,Not one of the crew had ever seen or heard of such fishing before
5,happiness,pride,so my pride and pleasure may he imagined
6,null,null,A little learning may be a dangerous thing at times
7,null,null,but it certainly is often handy to have about you .
1801 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Next day
2,null,null,and for a whole week after
3,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
4,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner "
5,surprise,amazing,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
1825 10
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,null,null,to our great joy
4,null,null,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,surprise,surprise,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .
1827 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thenceforward for another hour
2,null,null,in spite of all our efforts
3,null,null,we could not get within striking distance
4,null,null,mainly because of the close attention of the cow
5,null,null,which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother
6,disgust,impatient,I was getting so impatient of this hindrance
7,null,null,that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow
8,null,null,though I felt convinced that
9,null,null,if I did
10,null,null,I should spoil a good job .
1829 9
 (8, 8),(8, 9),
1,null,null,The ceaseless motion of the vessel rocking at the centre of a circular space of blue
2,null,null,with a perfectly symmetrical dome of azure enclosing her above
3,null,null,un flecked by a single cloud
4,null,null,becomes at last almost unbearable from its changeless sameness of environment
5,null,null,Were it not for the trivial round and common task of everyday ship duty
6,null,null,some of the crew must become idiotic
7,null,null,or
8,anger,rage,in sheer rage at the want of interest in their lives
9,null,null,commit mutiny .
1830 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Such a weary time was ours for full four weeks after sighting Christmas Island
2,sadness,exhausted,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
3,null,null,for never a spout did we see
4,null,null,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
5,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time .
1844 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,That being settled
2,null,null,we anchored the boat
3,null,null,and lit pipes
4,null,null,preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances
5,disgust,troubling,the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf
6,null,null,Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light
7,null,null,shed in the wake of no ordinary sized fish
8,null,null,probably an immense shark .
1845 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But we lost no time in getting back to the ship
2,null,null,where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into
3,null,null,The captain
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,was very kind
6,happiness,pleasure,expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again
7,null,null,although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future
8,null,null,A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure
9,null,null,so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again .
1854 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Before we left finally for New Zealand
2,null,null,every one of those Kanakas was as much at home in the whale boats as he would have been in a canoe
3,null,null,Of course they were greatly helped by their entire familiarity with the water
4,fear,dread,which took from them all that dread of being drowned which hampers the white  "  greenie "   so sorely
5,null,null,besides which
6,null,null,the absolute confidence they had in our prowess amongst the whales freed them from any fear on that head .
1861 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Making myself at home with him
2,null,null,I desired to know what brought him so far from the  "  big smoke
3,null,null,"   and on board a whaler of all places in the world
4,null,null,He told me he had been a Pickford 's van driver
5,null,null,but had emigrated to New Zealand
6,disgust,did not at all like,finding that he did not at all like himself in the new country
7,null,null,Trying to pick and choose instead of manfully choosing a pick and shovel for a beginning
8,null,null,he got hard up .
1866 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This announcement
2,null,null,though expected for some time past
3,null,null,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
4,surprise,strange,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
5,null,null,where stern
6,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule
7,null,null,The captain
8,null,null,well pleased with the eagerness manifested
9,null,null,had his boat manned for a trip to the entrance of the harbour
10,null,null,to see what the weather was like outside
11,null,null,since it was not possible to judge from where the ship lay .
1882 12
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,When he had done these things
2,null,null,and gone back to his own land
3,null,null,one Skat entertained him at a banquet
4,null,null,desirous to mingle his toilsome warfare with joyous licence
5,null,null,Frode was lying in his house
6,null,null,in royal fashion
7,null,null,upon cushions of cloth of gold
8,null,null,and a certain Hunding challenged him to fight
9,null,null,Then
10,null,null,though he had bent his mind to the joys of wassail
11,happiness,delight,he had more delight in the prospect of a fray than in the presence of a feast
12,null,null,and wound up the supper with a duel and the duel with a triumph .
1886 11
 (9, 9),(11, 9),
1,null,null,They found that Ragnar was dead
2,null,null,and that Kraka had already married one Brak
3,null,null,Then they remembered the father 's treasure
4,null,null,dug up the money
5,null,null,and bore it off
6,null,null,But Erik 's fame had gone before him
7,null,null,and Gotar had learnt all his good fortune
8,null,null,Now when Gotar learnt that he had come himself
9,fear,feared,he feared that his immense self-confidence would lead him to plan the worst against the Norwegians
10,null,null,and was anxious to take his wife from him and marry him to his own daughter in her place :  for his queen had just died
11,fear,anxious,and he was anxious to marry the sister of Frode more than anyone .
1911 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars
2,null,null,This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right
3,null,null,and he knew exactly what to do with it
4,fear,panic,A panic had come since Mr Semple had died
5,null,null,which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was
6,null,null,There was really a severe business depression .
1922 10
 (8, 9),(8, 10),
1,null,null,It was about two o'clock when Hubert had entered the gorge
2,null,null,It was after three when his father had roused him
3,null,null,and made his vain effort to save him
4,null,null,Hubert was now left alone with the rising tide
5,null,null,whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity
6,null,null,The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters
7,null,null,He tried to trust to his father 's promise
8,fear,terror,but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm
9,null,null,for every moment the wind grew fiercer
10,null,null,and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity .
1928 13
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,When the cage stopped
2,null,null,I found myself on a ridge of rock
3,null,null,and below me
4,null,null,the chasm
5,null,null,taking a slanting direction
6,null,null,shot down to a considerable depth
7,null,null,the darkness of which my lamp could not have penetrated
8,null,null,But through it
9,happiness,surprise,to my infinite surprise
10,null,null,streamed upward a steady brilliant light
11,null,null,Could it be any volcanic fire
12,null,null,In that case
13,null,null,surely I should have felt the heat .
1943 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,' what do you mean there are hundreds of children over there
2,null,null,' asked Father
3,null,null,' what do you know of what goes on over there
4,fear,worried,' Bruno opened his mouth to speak but worried that he would get himself into trouble if he revealed too much
5,null,null,' i can see them from my bedroom window
6,null,null,' he said finally
