2,happiness,fearlessly,A few men without property can cross their lands fearlessly
3,null,null,though a single individual with property would stand no chance
4,null,null,for they are insatiable thieves

6,null,null,as the chiefs take their taxes by deputy

13,null,null,when

18,null,null,floundering about like fish on land
19,null,null,repeated the same words over again and again
20,null,null,and rose doing the same

7,null,null,when
8,null,null,by appearance
9,null,null,we might have boated it from the head of the creek all the way down
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,on inquiry
12,null,null,was informed of the swampy nature of the ground at the head of the creek precluded any approach to the clear water there
13,null,null,and hence the long overland journey
14,null,null,which
15,null,null,though fatiguing to the unfortunate women

6,null,null,almost contempt
7,null,null,for big Tom Magee lying on the floor unable to lift his head

9,null,null,too
10,null,null,the strange absence of anything like elation at the doctor 's words

2,null,null,and the remembrance of his gaunt face haunted me for many years after

2,null,null,There was the dead dog
3,null,null,however
4,null,null,to prove that his conjecture had been correct
5,null,null,It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away

391 9
 (1, 6),(9, 6),
1,fear,despair,Deeply moved by the sight of this despair

10,null,null,"  that you never applied to your former employer
11,null,null,the Count de Chalusse .  "
407 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It was the old
2,null,null,sad story of a ruined girl paying for a moment 's madness with her happiness and all her after life
3,null,null,A terrible drama
4,null,null,no doubt
5,null,null,but one that is of such frequent occurrence that it seems as commonplace as life itself
6,null,null,Thus any one who was acquainted with M

8,null,null,"  Poor girl

2,null,null,given in a certain fashion
3,null,null,never fail to produce an effect diametrically opposed to that which they seemingly aim at

5,null,null,and the importance he attached to a mere trifle
6,null,null,could not fail to annoy the most patient man in the world
7,anger,irritated,and in fact his patronizing tone really irritated Pascal
8,null,null,"  You are free

431 9
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Clients became so numerous that Pascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre
2,null,null,and his rent was consequently doubled
3,null,null,but the income he derived from his profession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs safely invested as a resource against any emergency
4,null,null,Madame Ferailleur now laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband 's death
5,null,null,She felt that she owed it to Pascal
6,null,null,and

 (9, 9),
1,null,null,and
2,null,null,unfortunately
3,null,null,this prank cannot be attributed to a momentary fit of madness

14,null,null,I soon learned that he lived near by
15,null,null,with his widowed mother
16,null,null,and twice a day

18,null,null,he passed my home .  "

1,null,null,She clasped her hands

4,null,null,murmuring :   "  Oh
5,null,null,thanks
6,null,null,monsieur
7,null,null,thanks
8,null,null,"   For she was thinking of Pascal

10,null,null,sorrowful past
11,null,null,of which he was entirely ignorant
12,null,null,But the magistrate 's words had reassured her .

1518 6
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,And chiefest of them all is Thetis

3,null,null,for in her bowers She sheltered Dionysus and chased by might Of murderous Lycurgus from the earth

1,null,null,While long and loud Squealing they flee

 (8, 5),(8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,As night fell
2,null,null,the condition of the  "  greenies

4,null,null,was pitiable

7,null,null,bullied relentlessly by the ruthless petty officers well
8,sadness,sorry,I never felt so sorry for a lot of men in my life
9,null,null,Glad enough I was to get below into the folk ' sle for supper
10,null,null,and a brief rest and respite from that cruelty on deck .
1727 10
 (5, 6),(5, 7),(5, 8),
1,null,null,We were all gathered about the folk ' sle scuttle one evening
2,null,null,a few days after the gale referred to in the previous chapter
3,null,null,and the question of whale fishing came up for discussion
4,null,null,Until that time
5,surprise,strange,strange as it may seem
6,null,null,no word of this
7,null,null,the central idea of all our minds
8,null,null,had been mooted
9,null,null,ery man seemed to shun the subject
10,null,null,although we were in daily expectation of being called upon to take an active part in whale fighting .
1734 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle
8,surprise,surprised,which they had surprised during his morning 's nap
9,null,null,e of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat 's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,diving deep
12,null,null,came up underneath him .
1748 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,annoyed,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders
7,null,null,Great was our delight at the news .

4,null,null,so long as they were free and the sun shone brightly
5,null,null,We had many opportunities of cultivating their acquaintance
6,null,null,for the captain allowed us much liberty
7,null,null,quite one half of the crew and officers being ashore most of the time .
1772 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It will not
2,null,null,of course
3,null,null,have escaped the reader 's notice that I have not hitherto attempted to give any details concerning the structure of the whale just dealt with
4,null,null,The omission is intentional
5,null,null,During this
6,null,null,our first attempt at real whaling
7,fear,disturbed,my mind was far too disturbed by the novelty and danger of the position in which I found myself for the first time

1799 10
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,It is
2,null,null,perhaps

5,sadness,Poor,Poor wretches
6,null,null,What terrible calamity had befallen them
7,null,null,we could not guess
8,null,null,whatever it was

1830 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Such a weary time was ours for full four weeks after sighting Christmas Island
2,sadness,exhausted,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
3,null,null,for never a spout did we see
4,null,null,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
5,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time .
1838 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,We who had been rescued
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,were summarily ordered below by the skipper
4,null,null,and forbidden
5,sadness,pain,on pain of his severe displeasure
6,null,null,to reappear until the following morning
7,null,null,This great privilege we gladly availed ourselves of
8,null,null,awaking at daylight quite well and fit
9,null,null,not a bit the worse for our queer experience of the previous day .
1846 12
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But
2,null,null,alas for the fruit of our labours
3,null,null,Those hungry monsters had collected in thousands
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,to judge from what we were able to see of the body
6,surprise,alarmingly,they had reduced its value alarmingly
7,null,null,However
8,null,null,we commenced towing
9,null,null,and were getting along fairly well
10,null,null,when a long spur of reef to leeward of us
11,null,null,over which the sea was breaking frightfully
12,null,null,seemed to be stretching farther out to intercept us before we could get into smooth water .
1857 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Though they had but been dwellers on the threshold of the mountain
2,null,null,as it were
3,null,null,and any extension of their territory impossible by reason of the insurmountable barrier around them
4,happiness,untroubled,they had led an untroubled life
5,null,null,all unknowing of the fearful forces beneath their feet
6,null,null,But now they found the foundations of the rocks beneath breaking up
7,null,null,that withering
8,null,null,incessant shower of ashes and scoriae destroyed all their crops
1862 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,There were sixteen white men on board the CHANCE
2,null,null,including the skipper
3,null,null,drawn as usual from various European and American sources
4,null,null,the rest of her large crew of over forty all told being made up of Maories and half-breeds
5,null,null,One common interest united them
6,null,null,making them the most jolly crowd I ever saw their devotion to their commander
7,null,null,There was here to be found no jealousy of the Maories being officers and harpooner s
8,null,null,no black looks or discontented murmuring
9,happiness,satisfied,all hands seemed particularly well satisfied with their lot in all its bearings
10,null,null,so that
11,null,null,although the old tub was malodorous enough to turn even a pretty strong stomach
12,null,null,it was a leasure to visit her cheerful crowd for the sake of their enlivening society .
1876 10
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,These lines seemed all the deeper to-night
2,null,null,Only a few hours before
3,null,null,Richard had come to her
4,null,null,while Malachi was arranging his clothes
5,null,null,with the joyful news of a new device which he had developed during the day for his motor
6,null,null,He could hardly wait to tell her
7,null,null,he had said
8,happiness,joyful,The news was anything but joyful to her
9,null,null,She knew what it meant she knew what sums had been wasted on the other devices
10,null,null,involving losses which at this time they could so little afford .
1884 13
 (9, 9),

2,null,null,when he saw the necklace that he had given to Rolf left among the other golden ornaments
3,null,null,gazed fixedly upon the dearest treasure of his avarice
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,in order to pick up the plunder
6,null,null,glued his knees to the earth and deigned to stoop his royalty unto greed
7,null,null,Rolf
8,null,null,seeing him lie abjectly on his face in order to gather up the money
9,happiness,smiled,smiled at the sight of a man prostrated by his own gifts
10,null,null,just as if he were seeking covetously to regain what he had craftily yielded up
11,null,null,The Swedes were content with their booty
12,null,null,and Rolf quickly retired to his ships
13,null,null,and managed to escape by rowing violently .
1906 8
 (5, 1),(5, 4),
1,null,null,This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight
2,null,null,for my cows were eaten up
3,null,null,and my men clamouring incessantly for food
4,null,null,and though they might by orders help themselves  "  ku n'yangania "   by seizing from the Waganda
5,sadness,hurt,it hurt my feelings so much to witness this
6,null,null,that I tried from the first to dispense with it
7,null,null,telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing
8,null,null,and now he turned them into a pack of thieves .

4,null,null,He was still delicate the least promising of the family
5,null,null,He was queer and fanciful
6,null,null,and rather silent
7,null,null,He walked in his sleep and was often found in the middle of the night
8,null,null,fretting with the cold
9,null,null,in some dark corner
10,null,null,Once he heard that a neighbor 's children had the measles
11,null,null,and

16,null,null,He confessed
17,null,null,long after
18,null,null,that the scene gratified him

9,null,null,and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and unmanly
10,null,null,and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic might not seize him and disgrace him for ever

5,null,null,Rouen
6,null,null,and many other places
7,null,null,to enforce forbearance on his soldiery
8,null,null,who regarded plunder as their lawful prey
9,null,null,the enemy as their natural game

13,null,null,rapacious
14,null,null,and insubordinate became their temper
15,null,null,Well knowing the greatness of the peril

19,sadness,sadly,he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender
20,null,null,when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his escutcheon

8,null,null,he staggered to the stairs
9,null,null,Christina rushed after him
