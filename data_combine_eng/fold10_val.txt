7,null,null,the closer they huddled together

1,fear,tensed,He tensed slightly and got ready to make a run for it if necessary
2,null,null,But nothing seemed to be making Father angry today and if Bruno was honest with himself he would have admitted that Father rarely became angry
3,null,null,he became quiet and distant and always had his way in the end anyway and rather than shouting at him or chasing him around the house
4,null,null,he simply shook his head and indicated that their debate was at an end .

 (6, 1),(6, 2),
1,null,null,Bruno recognized footsteps pounding up the stairs towards them

7,happiness,grateful,The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes
8,null,null,He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision
9,null,null,because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat .
661 5

1,null,null,Bruno had the shampoo as well
2,null,null,but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno 's hair off

7,null,null,which he could easily carry in his belt
8,null,null,During this time the old woman was busy over her prayers
9,null,null,and when she had finished she came and prostrated herself twice before my brother
10,null,null,and then rising called down endless blessings on his head
11,null,null,Observing her shabby clothes
12,null,null,my brother thought that her gratitude was in reality a hint that he should give her some money to buy some new ones
13,null,null,so he held out two pieces of gold

11,null,null,I hurried after him to console him for his misfortunes

1,null,null,For two months I hunted thus
2,null,null,and no day passed without my securing
3,null,null,an elephant
4,null,null,Of course I did not always station myself in the same tree
5,null,null,but sometimes in one place
6,null,null,sometimes in another
7,null,null,One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised to see that
8,null,null,instead of passing the tree I was in
9,null,null,as they usually did
10,null,null,they paused
11,null,null,and completely surrounded it
12,null,null,trumpeting horribly
13,null,null,and shaking the very ground with their heavy tread
14,null,null,and when I saw that their eyes were fixed upon me
15,fear,was terrified,I was terrified
16,null,null,and my arrows dropped from my trembling hand
17,null,null,I had indeed good reason for my terror when
18,null,null,an instant later
19,null,null,the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree
20,null,null,and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots
21,null,null,bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches
22,null,null,I thought now that my last hour was surely come
23,null,null,but the huge creature
24,null,null,picking me up gently enough
25,null,null,set me upon its back
26,null,null,where I clung more dead than alive
27,null,null,and followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest
28,null,null,It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant
29,null,null,and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd
30,null,null,which turned and trampled off in another direction
31,null,null,and were soon hidden in the dense underwood
32,null,null,Then
33,null,null,recovering myself
34,null,null,I looked about me
35,null,null,and found that I was standing upon the side of a great hill
36,null,null,strewn as far as I could see on either hand with bones and tusks of elephants
37,null,null,"  This then must be the elephants ' burying place
38,null,null,"   I said to myself
39,null,null,"  and they must have brought me here that I might cease to persecute them
40,null,null,seeing that I want nothing but their tusks
41,null,null,and here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime .  "

 (30, 30),
1,null,null,At daylight we wandered inland
2,null,null,and soon saw some huts
3,null,null,to which we directed our steps
4,null,null,As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us
5,null,null,and we were led to their houses
6,null,null,and as it were divided among our captors
7,null,null,I with five others was taken into a hut
8,null,null,where we were made to sit upon the ground
9,null,null,and certain herbs were given to us
10,null,null,which the blacks made signs to us to eat
11,null,null,Observing that they themselves did not touch them
12,null,null,I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion
13,null,null,but my companions
14,null,null,being very hungry
15,null,null,rashly ate up all that was set before them
16,null,null,and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad
17,null,null,Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said
18,null,null,nor did they heed when I spoke to them
19,null,null,The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil
20,null,null,of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly
21,null,null,but I only tasted a few grains
22,null,null,understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating
23,null,null,and this was exactly what happened
24,null,null,My unlucky companions having lost their reason
25,null,null,felt neither anxiety nor fear
26,null,null,and ate greedily all that was offered them
27,null,null,So they were soon fat and there was an end of them
28,null,null,but I grew leaner day by day
29,null,null,for I ate but little
30,fear,fear,and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me
31,null,null,However
32,null,null,as I was so far from being a tempting morsel
33,null,null,I was allowed to wander about freely
34,null,null,and one day
35,null,null,when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me
36,null,null,I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest
37,null,null,running faster the more he cried to me to come back
38,null,null,until I had completely distanced him .
764 14
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,How long I slept I know not
2,null,null,but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone
3,null,null,I rushed to and fro like one distracted
4,sadness,despair,uttering cries of despair
5,null,null,and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon
6,null,null,I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety
7,null,null,But since wishes could do me no good
8,null,null,I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape
9,null,null,When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,finding nothing hopeful there
12,null,null,I turned landward
13,null,null,and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object
14,null,null,so far off that I could not make out what it might be .

4,null,null,He went to open it
5,null,null,and was immediately seized by the captain and sailors
6,null,null,who without a word of explanation forcibly bore him off to the boat
7,null,null,which took them back to the ship without loss of time
8,null,null,No sooner were they on board than they weighed anchor and set sail .

5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs

6,null,null,I come to tell you that it is no mockery
7,null,null,that it as surely lies there
8,null,null,a blazing furnace
9,null,null,in front of us as though we saw it with our own eyes
978 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Nevertheless there did come to her suddenly then a new tenderness for her aunt
2,sadness,pain,the actual sight of her pain in the Chapel had deeply touched her and now her eagerness for escape was mingled with a longing to be affectionate and good .

1014 5
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,uncomfortable,Maggie had an uncomfortable feeling that her aunt had in some way mysteriously defeated her by this sudden abandonment of all protest
2,null,null,and for a moment the mysterious house closed around her
3,null,null,with its shadows and dim corners and the little tinkling Chapel hell in the heart of it
4,null,null,But the thought of Martin dissolved the shadows
5,null,null,and off she went .
1034 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her
2,happiness,confused,She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because he seemed glad to see her

1,null,null,The Lyric Theatre was their destination
2,null,null,Maggie drew a breath as they stepped into the hall where there stood two large stout commissionaires in blue uniforms

5,null,null,People pushed past them and hurried down the stairs on either side as though a theatre were a Nothing
6,sadness,feeling lonely,Maggie stood there fingering her gloves and feeling lonely
7,null,null,The oil painting of a beautiful lady with a row of shining teeth faced her
8,null,null,There were also some palms and a hole in the wall with a man behind it .
1052 11
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Martin
2,null,null,dear
3,null,null,try and write every day
4,null,null,even if it 's only the shortest line

 (6, 7),
1,null,null,She
2,null,null,knowing nothing of the world

5,null,null,Maggie sped upstairs
6,null,null,and now with Martin 's words in her ears
7,null,null,had enough to stiffen her back for the battle .

 (15, 6),(15, 7),(15, 8),(15, 9),(15, 10),
1,null,null,Maggie wondered
2,null,null,as she looked about her
3,null,null,how she could have raised in her own imagination
4,null,null,around the Chapel and its affairs
5,null,null,so formidable an atmosphere of terror and tyrannic discipline
6,null,null,Here gathered together were a few women
7,null,null,tired
8,null,null,pale
9,null,null,many of them uneducated
10,null,null,awaiting like children the opening of a box
11,null,null,the springing into flower of a dry husk of a seed
12,null,null,the raising of the curtain on some wonderful scene
13,null,null,Maggie
14,null,null,as she looked at them
15,sadness,disappointed,knew that they must be disappointed
16,null,null,and her heart ached for them all
17,null,null,yes
18,null,null,even for Amy Warlock
19,null,null,her declared enemy .
1062 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,She only saw them all tired and hungry and expectant
2,null,null,perhaps
3,null,null,after all
4,null,null,there WAS something behind it all something for which they had a right to be searching
5,happiness,touched and moved,even of that she had not sure knowledge  but the pathos and also the bravery of their search touched and moved her
6,null,null,She was beginning to understand something of the beauty that hovered like a bird always just out of sight about the ugly walls of the Chapel .
1065 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Maggie thought
2,null,null,watching her aunt 's austere composure from the other side of the dining table
3,sadness,sad,She was sad at the thought of that
4,null,null,remembering moments that first visit to St
5,null,null,Dreot 's
6,null,null,the departure in the cab
7,null,null,the night when she had sat at her aunt 's bedside that had given glimpses of the kind human creature Aunt Anne might have been had she never heard of the Inside Saints .
1078 7
 (5, 6),(5, 7),
1,null,null,"  You know that it 's better for me to go
2,null,null,"   said Maggie
3,null,null,"  We cant live together any more after what happened
4,null,null,You and Aunt Elizabeth have been very very good to me
5,sadness,disappointment,but you know now that im a disappointment

2,null,null,and one day suddenly
3,surprise,surprise,to his own surprise
4,null,null,when they were alone in the drawing-room

3,null,null,"  im not practical of course
4,null,null,I dont know what one should do
5,null,null,but I do know that no one should be shut up .  "
1112 4

2,null,null,she had nothing much to say unless to some one in whom she was interested
3,fear,frightened,She was frightened lest something should happen to the tea
4,null,null,and she felt that they were all staring at her and asking themselves why her hair was cut short and why her clothes didnt fit better .

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,despair,It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune
2,null,null,which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country
3,null,null,Moreover
4,null,null,he had once more lost the Princess Badoura 's talisman
5,null,null,which he feared he might never see again
6,null,null,There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done
7,null,null,and to live on in the cottage
8,null,null,As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself
9,null,null,he engaged a lad to help him
10,null,null,and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars
11,null,null,filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport .

 (30, 30),
1,null,null,The African magician had a younger brother
2,null,null,who was
3,null,null,if possible
4,null,null,more wicked and more cunning than himself
5,null,null,He travelled to China to avenge his brother 's death
6,null,null,and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima
7,null,null,thinking she might be of use to him
8,null,null,He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast
9,null,null,telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death
10,null,null,He changed clothes with her
11,null,null,coloured his face like hers
12,null,null,put on her veil and murdered her
13,null,null,that she might tell no tales
14,null,null,Then he went towards the palace of Aladdin
15,null,null,and all the people thinking he was the holy woman
16,null,null,gathered round him
17,null,null,kissing his hands and begging his blessing
18,null,null,When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter
19,null,null,The slave said it was the holy woman
20,null,null,curing people by her touch of their ailments
21,null,null,whereupon the princess
22,null,null,who had long desired to see Fatima
23,null,null,sent for her
24,null,null,On coming to the princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity
25,null,null,When he had done the princess made him sit by her
26,null,null,and begged him to stay with her always
27,null,null,The false Fatima
28,null,null,who wished for nothing better
29,null,null,consented
30,fear,fear,but kept his veil down for fear of discovery
31,null,null,The princess showed him the hall
32,null,null,and asked him what he thought of it .

1,null,null,The Caliph
2,surprise,surprised,much surprised at this request
3,null,null,replied gently :    "  My good man
4,null,null,that which you ask is impossible
5,null,null,Of what use would my alms be if I treated you so ill
6,null,null,"    And as he spoke he tried to loosen the grasp of the blind beggar .

7,null,null,by the perfect storm of wildcat money which was floating about and which was constantly coming to his bank discounted

9,null,null,and handed out again to anxious borrowers at a profit

2,null,null,great and small
3,null,null,in those days
4,null,null,issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity
5,null,null,and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr
6,null,null,Cowperwood 's position
7,null,null,As a result
8,null,null,he had become the soul of caution
9,sadness,Unfortunately,Unfortunately
10,null,null,for him
11,null,null,he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field magnetism and vision
12,null,null,He was not destined to be a great financier

1,null,null,It was only two weeks later that Frank took his departure from Waterman & Company

6,null,null,His family did not entirely approve
7,null,null,She was too old

16,null,null,not true
17,null,null,His brothers
18,null,null,Joseph and Edward
19,null,null,were interested

1,null,null,And Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood
3,null,null,in spite of the difference in their years
4,null,null,appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time

8,null,null,responsive
9,null,null,dreamy
10,null,null,His mood and hers was for a baby
11,happiness,happy,and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her
12,null,null,She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself
13,null,null,and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so .
1222 9

1,null,null,The children took up a great deal of her time
2,null,null,However
3,null,null,Cowperwood was not troubled about this

5,null,null,At the same time
6,null,null,her lethargic manner
7,null,null,vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference
8,null,null,which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security
9,null,null,attracted him also .

1,null,null,There were then two famous American sculptors
2,null,null,Powers and Hosmer
3,null,null,of whose work he had examples
4,null,null,but Ellsworth told him that they were not the last word in sculpture and that he should look into the merits of the ancients
5,null,null,He finally secured a head of David

8,anger,flared up,She flared up at the injustice of things why could n't he have been rich and refined
9,null,null,too
10,null,null,Then they could have but
11,null,null,oh
12,null,null,what was the use of complaining
13,null,null,They would never get anywhere with her father and mother in charge

33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit

4,null,null,some financial
5,null,null,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
6,null,null,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
7,null,null,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton
8,null,null,And yet
9,null,null,as he had also learned
10,null,null,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
11,anger,irritated,This irritated Cowperwood
12,null,null,as it would always irritate any strong
13,null,null,acquisitive
14,null,null,direct seeing temperament
15,null,null,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
16,null,null,why should there be concealment between them
17,null,null,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
18,null,null,Why do one thing and think another
19,null,null,To be sure
20,null,null,she was devoted to him in her quiet way
21,null,null,not passionately ( as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that )
22,null,null,but intellectually
23,null,null,Duty
24,null,null,as she understood it
25,null,null,played a great part in this .
1296 10
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,He paused
2,null,null,She still gazed thoughtfully at the water below
3,null,null,her mind running out to a yacht on the sea with him
4,null,null,a palace somewhere  just they two
5,null,null,Her eyes
6,null,null,half closed
7,null,null,saw this happy world

10,happiness,fascinated,she was fascinated .
1306 7
 (1, 2),
1,happiness,intoxicated,This intoxicated him
2,null,null,for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long contemplated dream that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line
3,null,null,issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public
4,null,null,using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way
5,null,null,In short
6,null,null,he was one of those early
7,null,null,daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement .

 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The wonder of his financial and artistic and future social dreams

8,null,null,as well as the delight of all this .
1319 15
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,They were allied in no one particular financial proposition
2,null,null,any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were
3,null,null,And besides
4,null,null,in all probability Cowperwood was no fool
5,null,null,He was not equally guilty with Stener
6,null,null,the latter had loaned him money
7,null,null,The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues
8,null,null,but he decided not
9,null,null,Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind
10,fear,dangerous,It was a splendid chance but dangerous
11,null,null,He had better go it alone
12,null,null,For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could
13,null,null,If not
14,null,null,Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party
15,null,null,if need be .
