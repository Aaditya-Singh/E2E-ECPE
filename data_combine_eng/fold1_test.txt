 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Fortunat would certainly have preferred to lose a good pound of flesh rather than the sum of money mentioned
2,null,null,but
3,null,null,on the other hand
4,null,null,he felt that it would not do for him to sever his connection with his client until the death of the Count de Chalusse was certain
5,fear,anxious,and being anxious to save his money and to keep his client
6,null,null,his embarrassment was extreme
7,null,null,"  It was the most unfortunate thing in the world

431 9
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Clients became so numerous that Pascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre
2,null,null,and his rent was consequently doubled
3,null,null,but the income he derived from his profession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs safely invested as a resource against any emergency
4,null,null,Madame Ferailleur now laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband 's death
5,null,null,She felt that she owed it to Pascal
6,null,null,and
7,null,null,besides
8,null,null,after believing there was no more happiness left for her on earth
9,happiness,heart rejoiced,her heart rejoiced  at her son 's success .

3,happiness,enjoying,A score of gentlemen of high rank and immense wealth were enjoying a quiet game of baccarat
4,null,null,when it was observed that M
5,null,null,F   was winning in a most extraordinary manner
6,null,null,He was watched and detected in the very act of dexterously slipping some cards into the pack he held .
438 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,and
2,null,null,unfortunately
3,null,null,this prank cannot be attributed to a momentary fit of madness
4,null,null,for the fact that he had provided himself with these cards in advance proves the act to have been premeditated
5,null,null,One of the persons present was especially displeased
6,null,null,This was the Viscount de C
7,null,null,who had introduced M
8,null,null,F   to Madame d' a
9,disgust,annoyed,Extremely annoyed by this contretemps
10,null,null,he took umbrage at an offensive remark made by M
11,null,null,de R
12,null,null,and it was rumored that these gentlemen would cross swords at daybreak this morning .
454 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The clerk had been even less disturbed than the magistrate
2,null,null,He also was blase
3,null,null,having witnessed too many of those frightful and shameless dramas which are enacted at a dead man 's bedside
4,surprise,surprised,to be surprised at anything
5,null,null,If he had deigned to glance at the escritoire
6,null,null,it was only because he was curious to see how small a space would suffice to contain two millions
7,null,null,and then he had begun to calculate how many years he would be obliged to remain a clerk before he could succeed in amassing such a fabulous sum .
463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,null,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,null,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
470 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,surprise,frightened,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,null,null,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .
471 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would certainly have given me
2,null,null,I had his troth
3,null,null,and that sufficed
4,null,null,And it was with a thrill of joy that I said to myself :  ' what does it matter if M
5,anger,angered,de Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive me from his house
6,null,null,It will rather be so much the better
7,null,null,Pascal will protect me . '
487 19
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But M
2,null,null,Fortunat had resolved to listen to nothing
3,null,null,He wished for no explanations
4,fear,fear,so distrustful was he of himself so much did he fear that his adventurous nature would urge him to incur further risk
5,null,null,He was positively afraid of the Marquis de Valorsay 's eloquence
6,null,null,besides
7,null,null,he knew well enough that the person who consents to listen is at least half convinced
8,null,null,"  Tell me nothing
9,null,null,monsieur
10,null,null,"   he hastily answered
11,null,null,"  it would be useless
12,null,null,I have n't the money
13,null,null,If I had given you ten thousand francs last night
14,null,null,I should have been compelled to borrow them of M

7,null,null,not wanting to look like a baby in front of Maria

5,null,null,a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers
6,null,null,The more they were shouted at
7,null,null,the closer they huddled together
8,null,null,but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along
9,null,null,which was to stand in a single line
10,null,null,When they did
11,null,null,the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them
12,null,null,' it must be some sort of rehearsal
13,null,null,' suggested Gretel

2,null,null,But nothing seemed to be making Father angry today and if Bruno was honest with himself he would have admitted that Father rarely became angry
3,null,null,he became quiet and distant and always had his way in the end anyway and rather than shouting at him or chasing him around the house
4,null,null,he simply shook his head and indicated that their debate was at an end .

1,null,null,' everything here is horrible

4,null,null,and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether
5,null,null,During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence
6,null,null,nor did he find any doors to let him inside
7,sadness,despair,and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful
8,null,null,In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see
9,null,null,the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space .

2,null,null,These were things that Shmuel had told him
3,null,null,but for some reason he had not really understood at the time how sad that must have  made his friend
4,sadness,terrible,When Bruno said them out loud himself he felt terrible that he had not tried to say anything to cheer Shmuel up and instead had started talking about something silly
5,null,null,like exploring

7,null,null,the beard sank over the breast and huddled up in the chair as though life itself had left him

2,null,null,that he was not taking his life because of disappointment in love but because he felt that he never could enjoy what others found pleasurable
3,null,null,and that he was an anomaly
4,null,null,a curse to himself and others . He was sent away to a sanatorium but left it and came home . He began to eat and drink again
5,sadness,despair,found he could sleep at night ( the sleepless night had filled him with despair ) and soon swung back into his  "  normal "   state . He passes throughout life a spectator of the joys of others
6,null,null,wondering why his grip on content and desire is so slender

1,null,null,There was a perfect plague of State banks
2,null,null,great and small
3,null,null,in those days
4,null,null,issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity
5,null,null,and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr
6,null,null,Cowperwood 's position
7,null,null,As a result
8,null,null,he had become the soul of caution
9,sadness,Unfortunately,Unfortunately
10,null,null,for him
11,null,null,he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field magnetism and vision
12,null,null,He was not destined to be a great financier

5,null,null,As for Mr
6,null,null,Henry Waterman
7,null,null,he was actually irritated by this defection .
1193 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,At first
2,null,null,when Frank called
3,null,null,she did not have much to say
4,null,null,She was gracious
5,null,null,but the burden of conversation fell on her husband
6,null,null,Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time
7,null,null,and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something
8,happiness,Fortunately,Fortunately she was not
9,null,null,Semple talked to him pleasantly
10,null,null,because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant
11,null,null,was suave and ingratiating
12,null,null,and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line .
1197 12
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He could not think of her reasonably
2,null,null,and he did not talk of her much to any one
3,null,null,His family knew that he went to see her
4,happiness,a deep respect,but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family a deep respect for the mental force of Frank
5,null,null,He was genial
6,null,null,cheerful
7,null,null,gay at most times
8,null,null,without being talkative
9,null,null,and he was decidedly successful
10,null,null,Everybody knew he was making money now

4,null,null,he was not so sure that he wanted to stay in it
5,null,null,Gambling in stocks
6,null,null,according to conditions produced by this panic
7,null,null,seemed very hazardous

10,fear,in danger,Their very homes were in danger
11,null,null,they said
12,null,null,They would be wiped out
13,null,null,their wives and children put out on the street .
1215 27
 (11, 1),
1,null,null,Those who recall the early years of their married life can best realize the subtle changes which this new condition brought to Frank
2,null,null,for
3,null,null,like all who accept the hymeneal yoke
4,null,null,he was influenced to a certain extent by the things with which he surrounded himself
5,null,null,Primarily
6,null,null,from certain traits of his character
7,null,null,one would have imagined him called to be a citizen of eminent respectability and worth
8,null,null,He appeared to be an ideal home man
9,null,null,He delighted to return to his wife in the evenings
10,null,null,leaving the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried
11,happiness,physically happy,Here he could feel that he was well stationed and physically happy in life
12,null,null,The thought of the dinner table with candles upon it ( his idea )
13,null,null,the thought of Lillian in a trailing gown of pale blue or green silk he liked her in those colors
14,null,null,the thought of a large fireplace flaming with solid lengths of cord wood
15,null,null,and Lillian snuggling in his arms
16,null,null,gripped his immature imagination
17,null,null,As has been said before
18,null,null,he cared nothing for books
19,null,null,but life
20,null,null,pictures
21,null,null,trees
22,null,null,physical contact these
23,null,null,in spite of his shrewd and already gripping financial calculations
24,null,null,held him
25,null,null,To live richly
26,null,null,joyously
27,null,null,fully his whole nature craved that .
1219 16
 (13, 13),
1,null,null,And Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood
3,null,null,in spite of the difference in their years
4,null,null,appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time
5,null,null,She was once awakened
6,null,null,and for the time being
7,null,null,clinging
8,null,null,responsive
9,null,null,dreamy
10,null,null,His mood and hers was for a baby
11,null,null,and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her
12,null,null,She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself
13,happiness,delighted,and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so
14,null,null,It opened new possibilities a seemingly glorious future of which she was not afraid
15,null,null,He liked it
16,null,null,the idea of self duplication .
1223 9
 (4, 4),

2,null,null,However
3,null,null,Cowperwood was not troubled about this
4,happiness,exceedingly worth while,It struck him as delightful and exceedingly worth while that she should be so devoted
5,null,null,At the same time
6,null,null,her lethargic manner
7,null,null,vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference
8,null,null,which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security
9,null,null,attracted him also .
1234 9
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Sympathy and affection were great things
2,null,null,but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss
3,null,null,So often now he saw young girls who were quite in his mood
4,happiness,exceedingly robust,and who were exceedingly robust and joyous
5,null,null,It was fine
6,null,null,advisable
7,null,null,practical
8,null,null,to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon
9,null,null,but if you had a sickly wife .
1236 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,He was not at all sure
2,null,null,for instance
3,null,null,that the negroes could be made into anything much more significant than they were
4,null,null,At any rate
5,null,null,it was a long uphill struggle for them
6,null,null,of which many future generations would not witness the conclusion
7,null,null,He had no particular quarrel with the theory that they should be free
8,null,null,he saw no particular reason why the South should not protest vigorously against the destruction of their property and their system
9,disgust,too bad,It was too bad that the negroes as slaves should be abused in some instances
10,null,null,He felt sure that that ought to be adjusted in some way
11,null,null,but beyond that he could not see that there was any great ethical basis for the contentions of their sponsors .
1241 21
 (21, 8),(21, 9),
1,null,null,He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes
2,null,null,though he knew them to be trying to many
3,null,null,Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly
4,null,null,but
5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him
8,null,null,So he had gone his way day by day
9,null,null,watching the coming in and the departing of troops
10,null,null,seeing the bands of dirty
11,null,null,disheveled
12,null,null,gaunt
13,null,null,sickly men returning from the fields and hospitals
14,null,null,and all he could do was to feel sorry
15,null,null,This war was not for him
16,null,null,He had taken no part in it
17,null,null,and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in its conclusion not as a patriot
18,null,null,but as a financier
19,null,null,It was wasteful
20,null,null,pathetic
21,sadness,unfortunate,unfortunate .

1,null,null,"  Well

4,null,null,Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur
5,happiness,spirited,like a spirited collie 's
6,null,null,and her even teeth showed beautifully .
1286 25
 (12, 10),
1,null,null,At the same time
2,null,null,in contemplating his wife in connection with all this he had many qualms
3,null,null,some emotional
4,null,null,some financial
5,null,null,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
6,null,null,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
7,null,null,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton
8,null,null,And yet
9,null,null,as he had also learned
10,null,null,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
11,null,null,This irritated Cowperwood
12,anger,irritate,as it would always irritate any strong
13,null,null,acquisitive
14,null,null,direct seeing temperament
15,null,null,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
16,null,null,why should there be concealment between them
17,null,null,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
18,null,null,Why do one thing and think another
19,null,null,To be sure
20,null,null,she was devoted to him in her quiet way
21,null,null,not passionately ( as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that )
22,null,null,but intellectually
23,null,null,Duty
24,null,null,as she understood it
25,null,null,played a great part in this .
1311 13
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,after several years of this secret relationship
3,null,null,in which the ties of sympathy and understanding grew stronger instead of weaker
4,null,null,came the storm
5,surprise,unexpectedly,It burst unexpectedly and out of a clear sky
6,null,null,and bore no relation to the intention or volition of any individual
7,null,null,It was nothing more than a fire
8,null,null,a distant one the great Chicago fire
9,null,null,October 7th
10,null,null,1871
11,null,null,which burned that city  its vast commercial section to the ground
12,null,null,and instantly and incidentally produced a financial panic
13,null,null,vicious though of short duration in various other cities in America .
1328 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Stener stood there ridiculously meditating when
2,null,null,as a matter of fact
3,null,null,his very financial blood was oozing away

6,null,null,afraid of Cowperwood
7,fear,afraid,afraid of life and of himself
8,null,null,The thought of panic
9,null,null,loss
10,null,null,was not so much a definite thing connected with his own property
11,null,null,his money
12,null,null,as it was with his social and political standing in the community .

6,null,null,with their tender babes For husbands un returning

1,null,null,What time he dared that awful deed
2,sadness,groaned,when groaned All Oeta as he burned alive
3,null,null,and passed His soul into the air
4,null,null,leaving the man far famous
5,null,null,to be numbered with the Gods .

1655 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,He spake
2,null,null,and vanished
3,null,null,mingling with the winds
4,null,null,But their hearts felt the God 's power :  suddenly Flooded with boundless courage were their frames
5,anger,Maddened,Maddened their spirits :  on the foe they leapt Like furious wasps that in a storm of rage Swoop upon bees
6,null,null,beholding them draw nigh In latter summer to the mellowing grapes
7,null,null,Or from their hives forth streaming thitherward .
1661 7
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,ashamed,And how that he is quite ashamed of himself
2,null,null,and confesses how he had deserved this
3,null,null,for his baseness to his brother
4,null,null,And that he is like to pay part of the money
5,null,null,paid out of the Exchequer during the Committee of Safety
6,null,null,out of his own purse again
7,null,null,which I am glad on .
1674 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,After Cromwell had put down the House Of Peers
2,null,null,he was chosen a Member of the House of Commons
3,null,null,and sat with them

1677 7
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,In the afternoon my Lord and I walked together in the coach two hours
2,null,null,talking together upon all sorts of discourse :  as religion
3,null,null,wherein he is
4,null,null,I perceive
5,disgust,wholly sceptical,wholly sceptical
6,null,null,saying
7,null,null,that indeed the Protestants as to the Church of Rome are wholly fanatiques .
1689 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,After dinner Mr
2,null,null,Shepley and I in private talking about my Lord 's intentions to go speedily into the country
3,null,null,but to what end we know not
4,fear,fear,We fear he is to go to sea
5,null,null,with his fleet now preparing
6,null,null,But we wish that he could get his 4000l .
1690 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then in the Quire at the high altar
2,null,null,the King passed through all the ceremonies of the Coronation
3,sadness,grief,which to my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not see The crowne being put upon his head
4,null,null,a great shout begun
5,null,null,and he come forth to the throne
6,null,null,and there passed through more ceremonies .
1700 6
 (3, 5),
1,null,null,By water to White Hall
2,null,null,and there waited upon my Lord Sandwich
3,happiness,joyed,and joyed him
4,null,null,at his lodgings
5,null,null,of his safe coming home after all his danger
6,null,null,which he confesses to be very great .
1713 4
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,Groaned,The Locrian men Groaned
2,null,null,seeing their champion quelled by evil doom
3,null,null,For all his hair and all the stones around Were brain be spattered :  all his bones were crushed
4,null,null,And his once active limbs besprent with gore .
1749 15
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,You WANT somethin' to growl about
2,null,null,you do
3,null,null,"   Well
4,null,null,Cap'n George
5,null,null,"   said one of the men
6,null,null,"  you shorely dont think we k'n eat shells
7,null,null,do yer
8,null,null,"   Just then I caught sight of the kid 's contents
9,anger,indignation,and could hardly restrain my indignation
10,null,null,For in a dirty heap
11,null,null,the sight of which might have pleased an Esquimaux
12,null,null,but was certainly enough to disgust any civilized man
13,null,null,lay the calipee
14,null,null,or under shell of the turtle
15,null,null,hacked into irregular blocks .
1760 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A ruined house
2,null,null,surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead
3,null,null,stood in the middle of this piece of land
4,surprise,curious,Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be
5,null,null,I asked the mate if he knew anything of it
6,null,null,He told me that an American named Halstead
7,null,null,with his family
8,null,null,lived here for years
9,null,null,visited only by an occasional whaler
10,null,null,to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time .
1763 9
 (6, 9),
1,null,null,Nothing of advantage to our cargo was seen for a long time
2,null,null,which
3,null,null,although apparently what was to be expected
4,null,null,did not improve Captain Slocum 's temper
5,null,null,But
6,surprise,surprise,to the surprise of all
7,null,null,when we had arrived off the beautiful island of Hong Kong
8,null,null,to which we approached closely
9,null,null,we  "  raised "   a grand sperm whale .
1770 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He raised a gigantic tail on high
2,null,null,threshing the water with deafening blows
3,null,null,rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth
4,anger,agony,I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes
5,null,null,for Mr
6,null,null,Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger
7,null,null,although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan
8,null,null,In the agitated condition of the sea
9,null,null,it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to un ship the tall mast
10,null,null,which was of course the first thing to be done .
1782 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,afraid,The men were afraid to go on to the sick list
2,null,null,Nothing short of total inability to continue would have prevented them from working
3,null,null,such was the terror with which that man had inspired us all
4,null,null,It may be said that we were a pack of cowards
5,null,null,who
6,null,null,without the courage to demand better treatment
7,null,null,deserved all we got .
1783 8
 (3, 1),(3, 2),
1,null,null,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
2,null,null,half starved and hopeless
3,sadness,broken,their spirit had been so broken
4,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
5,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
6,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves
7,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
8,null,null,as I have before noted
1805 13
 (10, 1),(10, 2),(10, 3),(10, 4),
1,null,null,The sorely wounded monster
2,null,null,with one tremendous expiration
3,null,null,rolled over and over swift as thought towards his aggressor
4,null,null,literally burying the boat beneath his vast bulk
5,null,null,Now
6,null,null,one would have thought surely
7,null,null,upon seeing this
8,null,null,that none of that boat 's crew would ever have been seen again
9,null,null,Nevertheless
10,surprise,strange,strange as it may appear
11,null,null,out of that seething lather of foam
12,null,null,all six heads emerged again in an instant
13,null,null,but on the OTHER side of the great creature .
1807 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,fear,anxious,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,null,null,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant .
1836 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Samuela and Polly set to work with their sheath knives
2,null,null,and soon excavated a space in the blubber to enable them to reach the meat
3,null,null,Then they cut off some good-sized junks
4,null,null,and divided it up
5,null,null,It was not half bad
6,null,null,and as we chewed on the tough black fibre
7,happiness,smiling,I could hardly help smiling as I thought how queer a Christmas dinner we were having
8,null,null,But eating soon heightened our thirst
9,null,null,and our real sufferings then began .
1840 6
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,disgust,disgust,I have no doubt whatever that some of the gentry who swear at large about the evils of missionaries would have been loud in their disgust at the entire absence of drink and debauchery
2,null,null,and the prevalence of what they would doubtless characterize as adjective hypocrisy on the part of the natives
3,null,null,but no decent man could help rejoicing at the peace
4,null,null,the security
5,null,null,and friendliness manifested on every hand
6,null,null,nor help awarding unstinted praise to whoever had been the means of bringing about so desirable a state of things .
1847 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Taking stock of him quietly during our day-long leisurely cruises in the boat
2,null,null,I often wondered whether his mind still kept its gloomy forebodings
3,null,null,and brooded over his tragical life-history
4,null,null,I never dared to speak to him on the subject
5,fear,fear,for fear of arousing what I hoped was growing too faint for remembrance
6,null,null,But at times I saw him in the moonlit evenings sitting on the rail alone
7,null,null,steadfastly gazing down into the star besprent waters beneath him
8,null,null,as if coveting their unruffled peace .
1850 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,And
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable
4,null,null,so free from anything to regret
5,happiness,smile,Perhaps this simple statement will raise a cynical smile upon the lips of those who know Tahati
6,null,null,the New Hebrides
7,null,null,and kindred spots with all their savage
8,null,null,bestial orgies of alternate unbridled lust and unnamable cruelty .
1880 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,not only on his own account but on hers and his father 's
2,null,null,In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose
3,fear,fearing,fearing to wound his pride
4,null,null,she had put it solely on the ground of his settling down to some work .
1882 12
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,When he had done these things
2,null,null,and gone back to his own land
3,null,null,one Skat entertained him at a banquet
4,null,null,desirous to mingle his toilsome warfare with joyous licence
5,null,null,Frode was lying in his house
6,null,null,in royal fashion
7,null,null,upon cushions of cloth of gold
8,null,null,and a certain Hunding challenged him to fight
9,null,null,Then
10,null,null,though he had bent his mind to the joys of wassail
11,happiness,delight,he had more delight in the prospect of a fray than in the presence of a feast
12,null,null,and wound up the supper with a duel and the duel with a triumph .
1884 13
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,So Athisl
2,null,null,when he saw the necklace that he had given to Rolf left among the other golden ornaments
3,null,null,gazed fixedly upon the dearest treasure of his avarice
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,in order to pick up the plunder
6,null,null,glued his knees to the earth and deigned to stoop his royalty unto greed
7,null,null,Rolf
8,null,null,seeing him lie abjectly on his face in order to gather up the money
9,happiness,smiled,smiled at the sight of a man prostrated by his own gifts
10,null,null,just as if he were seeking covetously to regain what he had craftily yielded up
11,null,null,The Swedes were content with their booty
12,null,null,and Rolf quickly retired to his ships
13,null,null,and managed to escape by rowing violently .
1894 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness
2,null,null,and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house
3,sadness,sorrow,But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar
4,null,null,who had been expelled from the kingdom
5,null,null,For the Gauls had made him fly
6,null,null,and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella
7,null,null,the son of Hame .
1899 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,So he besought them to make his son RORIK king
2,null,null,so that the judgment of wicked men should not transfer the royalty to strange and unknown houses
3,happiness,joy,asserting that he would reap more joy from the succession of his son than bitterness from his own impending death
4,null,null,This request was speedily granted .
1902 15
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,This night one was shot
2,null,null,without any mistake about it
3,null,null,for the next morning we tracked him by his blood
4,null,null,and afterwards heard he had died of his wound
5,null,null,The Wasui elders
6,null,null,contrary to my expectation
7,null,null,then came and congratulated us on our success
8,happiness,wonderful,They thought us most wonderful men
9,null,null,and possessed of supernatural powers
10,null,null,for the thief in question was a magician
11,null,null,who until now was thought to be invulnerable
12,null,null,Indeed
13,null,null,they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people
14,null,null,but though they had so many more guns than ourselves
15,null,null,they never succeeded in killing one .
1922 10
 (8, 9),(8, 10),
1,null,null,It was about two o'clock when Hubert had entered the gorge
2,null,null,It was after three when his father had roused him
3,null,null,and made his vain effort to save him
4,null,null,Hubert was now left alone with the rising tide
5,null,null,whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity
6,null,null,The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters
7,null,null,He tried to trust to his father 's promise
8,fear,terror,but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm
9,null,null,for every moment the wind grew fiercer
10,null,null,and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity .
1929 4
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,horror,While I was bending over his corpse in grief and horror
2,null,null,I heard close at hand a strange sound between a snort and a hiss
3,null,null,and turning instinctively to the quarter from which it came
4,null,null,I saw emerging from a dark fissure in the rock a vast and terrible head
1930 22
 (12, 10),
1,null,null,Little Sam
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,was not yet ready to enjoy the island and the cave
4,null,null,He was still delicate the least promising of the family
5,null,null,He was queer and fanciful
6,null,null,and rather silent
7,null,null,He walked in his sleep and was often found in the middle of the night
8,null,null,fretting with the cold
9,null,null,in some dark corner
10,null,null,Once he heard that a neighbor 's children had the measles
11,null,null,and
12,fear,very anxious,being very anxious to catch the complaint
13,null,null,slipped over to the house and crept into bed with an infected playmate
14,null,null,Some days later
15,null,null,Little Sam 's relatives gathered about his bed to see him die
16,null,null,He confessed
17,null,null,long after
18,null,null,that the scene gratified him
19,null,null,However
20,null,null,he survived
21,null,null,and fell into the habit of running away
22,null,null,usually in the direction of the river .

1,null,null,In Tom Sawyer
2,null,null,Indian Joe dies in the cave
3,null,null,He did not die there in real life
4,null,null,but was lost there once and was very weak when they found him
5,null,null,He was not as bad as painted in the book
6,null,null,though he was dissolute and accounted dangerous
7,null,null,and when one night he died in reality
8,fear,so terrific,there came a thunderstorm so terrific that Sam Clemens at home
9,null,null,in bed
10,null,null,was certain that Satan had come in person for the half-breed 's soul
11,null,null,He covered his head and said his prayers with fearful anxiety lest the evil one might decide to save another trip by taking him along then .

1,null,null,Oh
2,null,null,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
3,null,null,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
4,null,null,and very nearly carried it off
5,null,null,f everybody minded their own business
6,null,null,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
7,null,null,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
8,null,null,Which would NOT be an advantage
9,null,null,' said Alice
10,null,null,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night
11,null,null,You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis ' Talking of axes
12,null,null,' said the Duchess
13,null,null,chop off her head
14,fear,anxiously,' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook
15,null,null,to see if she meant to take the hint
16,null,null,but the cook was busily stirring the soup
17,null,null,and seemed not to be listening
18,null,null,so she went on again :   Twenty-four hours
19,null,null,I THINK
20,null,null,or is it twelve
21,null,null,I ' Oh
22,null,null,dont bother ME
23,null,null,' said the Duchess
24,null,null,I never could abide figures
25,null,null,' And with that she began nursing her child again
26,null,null,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
27,null,null,and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :   Speak roughly to your little boy
28,null,null,And beat him when he sneezes :  He only does it to annoy
29,null,null,Because he knows it teases . '

7,null,null,without opening its eyes
8,null,null,Of course
9,null,null,of course
10,null,null,just what I was going to remark myself
11,null,null,Have you guessed the riddle yet

2,null,null,the fight was over

4,null,null,' thought Alice
5,null,null,as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
6,null,null,So she tucked it away under her arm
7,null,null,that it might not escape again
8,null,null,and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  .  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat
9,surprise,surprised,she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it :  there was a dispute going on between the executioner
10,null,null,the King
11,null,null,and the Queen
12,null,null,who were all talking at once
13,null,null,while all the rest were quite silent
14,null,null,and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared
15,null,null,she was appealed to by all three to settle the question
16,null,null,and they repeated their arguments to her
17,null,null,though
18,null,null,as they all spoke at once
19,null,null,she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
