1,null,null,He had just come up with a brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly
2,null,null,The math for making circles usually required calculating square roots
3,null,null,which the 68000 microprocessor didnt support
4,null,null,But Atkinson did a workaround based on the fact that the sum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect squares ( for example
5,null,null,1 + 3 = 4

1,null,null,Days rolled on

3,null,null,enlarging my zoological collection
4,null,null,and taking long series of astronomical observations until the 13th
5,sadness,depressed,when the whole of Kaze was depressed by a sad scene of mourning and tears
6,null,null,Some slaves came in that night having made their way through the woods from Ugogo

3,null,null,and Makaka
4,happiness,humour,in the best humour possible
5,null,null,came over to say I had permission to go when I liked

7,null,null,This was too provoking
8,null,null,The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever
9,null,null,and had made me feel quite sick
10,null,null,so I said
11,null,null,if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifer ss again
12,null,null,I would fight the matter out with him
13,null,null,for I had not come there to be bullied .
143 9

1,null,null,Leaving the valley of Uthenga
2,null,null,we rose over the spur of N'yamwara

5,null,null,how we enjoyed it
6,happiness,happy,every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika
7,null,null,Tripping down the greensward
8,null,null,we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley
9,null,null,and pitched our tents in the village .
150 10
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,the real facts of the case were these though I did not find them out at the time :   Baraka had bought some slaves with my effects
3,null,null,and he had had a fight with some of my men because they tampered with his temporary wife a princess he had picked up in Phunze
4,null,null,To obtain her hand he had given ten necklaces of MY beads to her mother
5,null,null,and had agreed to the condition that he should keep the girl during the journey
6,null,null,and after it was over
7,null,null,and he took her home
8,null,null,he would
9,happiness,pleased,if his wife pleased him
10,null,null,give her mother ten necklaces more .
163 9
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,he must understand that it was not the custom of big men in my country to accept presents of value when we made visits of pleasure
2,null,null,I had enjoyed my residence in Karague
3,null,null,his intellectual conversations and his kind hospitality
4,null,null,all of which I should record in my books to hand down to posterity
5,null,null,but if he would give me a cow 's horn
6,happiness,happy,I would keep it as a trophy of the happy days I had spent in his country
7,null,null,He gave me one
8,null,null,measuring 3 feet 5 inches in length
9,null,null,and 18 3/4 inches in circumference at the base .
167 14
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,The princes then
2,null,null,thinking me  "  green "   at this kind of sport
3,null,null,said the place was enchanted
4,null,null,but I need not fear
5,null,null,for they would bring them out to my feet by simply calling out certain names
6,null,null,and this was no sooner done than four old and one young one came immediately in font of us
7,null,null,It seemed quite a sin to touch them
8,sadness,innocent,they looked all so innocent
9,null,null,but as the king wanted to try me again
10,null,null,I gave one a ball on the head which sent him under
11,null,null,never again to be seen
12,null,null,for on the 22nd
13,null,null,by which time I supposed he ought to have risen inflated with gases
14,null,null,the king sent out his men to look out for him
175 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Until now I did not feel sure where the various rush drains I had been crossing since leaving the Katonga valley all went to
2,null,null,but here my mind was made up
3,null,null,for I found a large volume of water going to the northwards
4,null,null,I took off my clothes at the end of the bridge and jumped into the stream
5,null,null,which I found was twelve yards or so broad
6,null,null,and deeper than my height
7,happiness,delighted,I was delighted beyond measure at this very surprising fact
8,null,null,that I was indeed on the northern slopes of the continent
9,null,null,and had
10,null,null,to all appearance
11,null,null,found one of the branches of the Nile 's exit from the N'yanza .

5,null,null,"  but let us go and shoot some more
6,happiness,wonderful,for it is truly wonderful
7,null,null,Similar results followed
8,null,null,for the herons were continually whirling round
9,null,null,as they had their nests upon a neighbouring tree
193 8

4,fear,feared,and some who feared
5,null,null,and some who hated
6,null,null,for the sake of land and women

7,null,null,In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming
8,null,null,He paused and listened for an answer .
393 11
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,but I was wrong

3,null,null,through Madame Leon

1,null,null,The table itself was adorned with a rich tapestry cover
2,null,null,but this was visible only at the corners

6,null,null,Madame d' argeles 's guests were probably not over fifty in number
7,null,null,but they all seemed to belong to the very best society

6,null,null,It is not natural for a person to interest himself in other people 's misfortunes

3,null,null,The superior told me that I must deliberate and decide alone
4,null,null,and that when once my decision was taken
5,null,null,there could be no change
6,null,null,So I remained at the asylum

9,surprise,surprised,What surprised me most of all was the deference with which I was treated

4,null,null,coming as it did from a man whose life had been saved
5,null,null,according to his own confession
6,null,null,However
7,null,null,the person the Jehu anathematized certainly did not hear him
8,null,null,Standing motionless where he had alighted
9,null,null,Fortunat scrutinized the house in front of him with close attention
10,null,null,"  So she lives here
11,null,null,"   he muttered
12,null,null,"  This is the place
13,null,null,but I cant present myself without knowing her name
14,null,null,I must make some inquiries .  "
496 17
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The dismissal was so imperious that M

6,null,null,"  Crazy in the fullest sense of the word
7,fear,fear,She refuses the count 's millions from a silly fear of telling people that she belongs to the Chalusse family
8,null,null,She threatened her brother
9,null,null,but she would never have carried her threats into execution
10,null,null,And she prefers her present position to such a fortune
11,null,null,What lunacy
12,null,null,"   But
13,null,null,although he was disappointed and angry
14,null,null,he did not by any means despair

3,sadness,uncomfortable,Situations like that always  made Bruno feel very uncomfortable because
4,null,null,in his heart
5,null,null,he knew that there was no reason to be impolite to someone

 (8, 1),(8, 4),
1,null,null,' do you have many friends

6,null,null,' well
7,null,null,sort of
8,sadness,frowned,Bruno frowned
9,null,null,He had hoped that Shmuel might have said no as it would give them something else in common

608 11
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs
2,null,null,where they received a rare invitation into Father 's office
3,null,null,Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls
4,null,null,Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts
5,null,null,a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie
6,happiness,proud,He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them
7,null,null,even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk
8,null,null,All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant
9,null,null,all the same
10,null,null,because Bruno and Gretel were n't even invited to dinner
11,null,null,they had eaten an hour earlier .
612 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,' we wore the armbands for a few months

5,null,null,You dont mean Lieutenant Kotler
6,null,null,im just supposed to be cleaning the glasses
7,null,null,' he said

1,null,null,Bruno nodded and turned round and left the kitchen without looking back
2,sadness,His stomach churned inside him,His stomach churned inside him and he thought for a moment that he was going to be sick
3,null,null,He had never felt so ashamed in his life
4,null,null,he had never imagined that he could behave so cruelly
5,null,null,He wondered how a boy who thought he was a good person really could act in such a cowardly way towards a friend
6,null,null,He sat in the living room for several hours but could n't concentrate on his book and didnt dare to go back to the kitchen until later that evening
7,null,null,when Lieutenant Kotler had already come back and collected Shmuel and taken him away again .
660 3
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,It turned out that both Gretel and Bruno had lice in their hair
2,null,null,and Gretel had to be treated with a special shampoo that smelled horrible and afterwards she sat in her room for hours on end

664 5
 (4, 1),
1,null,null,When he saw his friend the next day Shmuel started to laugh at Bruno 's appearance
2,null,null,which didnt do a lot for his dwindling self-confidence
3,null,null,' i look just like you now
4,sadness,sadly,' said Bruno sadly
5,null,null,as if this was a terrible thing to admit .
667 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Nothing at all changed for a few weeks
2,null,null,life went on as normal
3,null,null,Father spent most of his time either in his office or on the other side of the fence
4,null,null,Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps
5,null,null,some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch
6,fear,worried,and Bruno was worried for her health because he 'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries
7,null,null,Gretel stayed in her room concentrating on the various maps she had pasted on the walls and consulting the newspapers for hours at a time before moving the pins around a little
8,null,null,( Herr Liszt was particularly pleased with her for doing this .  )
668 2
 (1, 1),

1,null,null,My Lord called me into the great cabin below
2,null,null,where he told me that the Presbyterians are quite mastered by the Cavaliers

4,null,null,I set our myself with a dozen men
5,null,null,and the following evening I put up with Musa

6,null,null,Marzavan asked if she could not manage to let him see the princess without the king 's knowledge .

 (14, 14),
1,null,null,In this same island we saw the rhinoceros
2,null,null,an animal which is smaller than the elephant and larger than the buffalo
3,null,null,It has one horn about a cubit long which is solid
4,null,null,but has a furrow from the base to the tip
5,null,null,Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man
6,null,null,The rhinoceros fights with the elephant
7,null,null,and transfixing him with his horn carries him off upon his head
8,null,null,but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy
9,null,null,he falls helpless to the ground
10,null,null,and then comes the roc
11,null,null,and clutches them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young
12,null,null,This doubtless astonishes you
13,null,null,but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself
14,fear,fear,For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful things which we saw in this island
15,null,null,Before we left I exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited greatly on our homeward way
16,null,null,At last we reached Balsora
17,null,null,whence I hastened to Bagdad
18,null,null,where my first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor
19,null,null,after which I settled down to enjoy tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain .
761 38
 (30, 30),
1,null,null,At daylight we wandered inland
2,null,null,and soon saw some huts
3,null,null,to which we directed our steps
4,null,null,As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us
5,null,null,and we were led to their houses
6,null,null,and as it were divided among our captors
7,null,null,I with five others was taken into a hut
8,null,null,where we were made to sit upon the ground
9,null,null,and certain herbs were given to us
10,null,null,which the blacks made signs to us to eat
11,null,null,Observing that they themselves did not touch them
12,null,null,I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion
13,null,null,but my companions
14,null,null,being very hungry
15,null,null,rashly ate up all that was set before them
16,null,null,and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad
17,null,null,Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said
18,null,null,nor did they heed when I spoke to them
19,null,null,The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil
20,null,null,of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly
21,null,null,but I only tasted a few grains
22,null,null,understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating
23,null,null,and this was exactly what happened
24,null,null,My unlucky companions having lost their reason
25,null,null,felt neither anxiety nor fear
26,null,null,and ate greedily all that was offered them
27,null,null,So they were soon fat and there was an end of them
28,null,null,but I grew leaner day by day
29,null,null,for I ate but little
30,fear,fear,and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me
31,null,null,However
32,null,null,as I was so far from being a tempting morsel
33,null,null,I was allowed to wander about freely
34,null,null,and one day
35,null,null,when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me
36,null,null,I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest
37,null,null,running faster the more he cried to me to come back
38,null,null,until I had completely distanced him .
762 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons
2,fear,feared,and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad
3,null,null,so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street
4,null,null,However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of
5,null,null,and urged him to obey the call so pressing ly that at last the porter was obliged to yield .
764 14
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,How long I slept I know not
2,null,null,but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone
3,null,null,I rushed to and fro like one distracted
4,sadness,despair,uttering cries of despair
5,null,null,and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon
6,null,null,I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety
7,null,null,But since wishes could do me no good
8,null,null,I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape
9,null,null,When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,finding nothing hopeful there
12,null,null,I turned landward
13,null,null,and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object
14,null,null,so far off that I could not make out what it might be .

 (2, 19),(20, 19),
1,null,null,Persecuted by ill fortune
2,sadness,grief,and stricken with grief
3,null,null,there seemed to be only one means of safety left to me
4,null,null,I shaved my beard and my eyebrows
5,null,null,and put on the dress of a calender
6,null,null,in which it was easy for me to travel without being known
7,null,null,I avoided the towns till I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph
8,null,null,haroun al raschid
9,null,null,when I had no further reason to fear my enemies
10,null,null,It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness
11,null,null,who would
12,null,null,I felt certain
13,null,null,be touched by my sad story
14,null,null,and would grant me
15,null,null,besides
16,null,null,his help and protection
17,null,null,hat you ask is impossible
18,null,null,"   she answered
19,null,null,"  but stay here with me instead
20,sadness,happy,and we can be happy
21,null,null,and all you will have to do is to betake yourself to the forest every tenth day
22,null,null,when I am expecting my master the genius
23,null,null,He is very jealous
24,null,null,as you know
25,null,null,and will not suffer a man to come near me .  "

5,null,null,and when he came said to him

7,null,null,bring me four more fish like you have brought already
8,null,null,for an accident has happened to them so that they cannot be served up to the Sultan .  "
775 12
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,"  In the third
2,null,null,I promised to make him a king
3,null,null,to be always near him
4,null,null,and to grant him three wishes every day
5,null,null,but that century passed away as the other two had done
6,null,null,and I remained in the same plight
7,anger,angry,At last I grew angry at being captive for so long
8,null,null,and I vowed that if anyone would release me I would kill him at once
9,null,null,and would only allow him to choose in what manner he should die
10,null,null,So you see

4,null,null,in the Freudian sense
5,null,null,a sort of homosexuality
6,null,null,Possibly
7,null,null,and there are very crude and coarse phrases of the common man indicating a sexual feeling in all victory and defeat . But I am inclined to call this a sort of monothymia
8,null,null,a mood of fear and negative self feeling coloring all the reactions . I have previously cited the case of the man obsessed by fear in all the relations of life
9,null,null,shrinking
10,null,null,self acknowledged inferiority who lost it with  "  a few drinks under my belt

8,null,null,when dying
9,null,null,the cachalot always ejected the contents of his stomach

5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs

26,null,null,undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her
27,null,null,There was no will

31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars

17,surprise,quite surprised,and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size :  to be sure
18,null,null,this generally happens when one eats cake
19,null,null,but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen
20,null,null,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
21,null,null,she set to work
22,null,null,and very soon finished off the cake .

7,null,null,Nigel and Lord Marmion were together at so great an interval that he could not fall back on them
