29,null,null,as it did not act
30,null,null,I did not expect the full price returned
31,null,null,but was willing to take half
32,null,null,The man said he could not do that - buying and selling were two different things

3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate

1103 5

2,null,null,and indeed did she allow her fancy to dwell
3,null,null,for a moment
4,fear,a panic,upon them she was besieged at once by so horrid a panic that she lost all control and self possession
5,null,null,She therefore very quickly put those things from her and thenceforth lived in the world as in a castle surrounded by a dark moat filled with horrible and slimy creatures who would raise a head at her did she so much as glance their way .

1,surprise,surprised,The queen was much surprised by these words
2,null,null,but when she declared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess lost all respect

1,null,null,When the dervish saw that the prince 's mind was made up
2,null,null,he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him
3,null,null,and held it out
4,null,null,"  If it must be so

17,null,null,above all
18,null,null,beware of ever turning your head
19,null,null,If you do

23,null,null,and have failed

25,null,null,If you manage to avoid this pitfall
26,null,null,and to reach the top of the mountain
27,null,null,you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage
28,null,null,and you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water
29,null,null,That is all I have to say
30,null,null,You know what you have to do

1,null,null,It was only two weeks later that Frank took his departure from Waterman & Company
2,null,null,interested and yet in no way flustered by his new prospects

1,null,null,Thereafter
2,null,null,for a year or so
3,null,null,Cowperwood bought his shoes of Mr
4,null,null,Semple
5,null,null,Occasionally also he stopped in the Chestnut Street store to exchange the time of the day
6,null,null,Semple asked his opinion as to the advisability of buying some shares in the Fifth and Sixth Street line
7,null,null,which
8,null,null,having secured a franchise
9,happiness,excitement,was creating great excitement
10,null,null,Cowperwood gave him his best judgment
11,null,null,It was sure to be profitable
12,null,null,He himself had purchased one hundred shares at five dollars a share
13,null,null,and urged Semple to do so
14,null,null,But he was not interested in him personally
15,null,null,He liked Mrs
16,null,null,Semple
17,null,null,though he did not see her very often .

6,happiness,aroused,He was very much aroused
7,null,null,excited .

 (1, 1),
1,happiness,was a great improvement,The home atmosphere which they established when they returned from their honeymoon was a great improvement in taste over that which had characterized the earlier life of Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood as Mrs
3,null,null,Semple
4,null,null,They had decided to occupy her house
5,null,null,on North Front Street
6,null,null,for a while at least .
1229 20
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,felt confident,And Cowperwood felt confident when he left the house that evening that Butler would not fail him but would set the wheels working
2,null,null,Therefore
3,null,null,he was not surprised
4,null,null,and knew exactly what it meant
5,null,null,when a few days later he was introduced to City Treasurer Julian Bode
6,null,null,who promised to introduce him to State Treasurer Van Nostrand and to see that his claims to consideration were put before the people
7,null,null,"  Of course
8,null,null,you know
9,null,null,"   he said to Cowperwood
10,null,null,in the presence of Butler
11,null,null,for it was at the latter 's home that the conference took place
12,null,null,"  this banking crowd is very powerful
13,null,null,You know who they are
14,null,null,They dont want any interference in this bond issue business
15,null,null,I was talking to Terrence Relihan
16,null,null,who represents them up there "   meaning Harrisburg
17,null,null,the State capital  "  and he says they wont stand for it at all
18,null,null,You may have trouble right here in Philadelphia after you get it theyre pretty powerful
19,null,null,you know
20,null,null,Are you sure just where you can place it
1250 25
 (25, 25),
1,null,null,Cowperwood knew that there were such properties
2,null,null,His very alert mind had long since sensed the general opportunities here
3,null,null,The omnibuses were slowly disappearing
4,null,null,The best routes were already preempted
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,there were other streets
7,null,null,and the city was growing
8,null,null,The incoming population would make great business in the future
9,null,null,One could afford to pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait and extend the lines into larger and better areas later
10,null,null,And already he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the  "  endless chain
11,null,null,"   or  "  agreeable formula
12,null,null,"   as it was later termed
13,null,null,of buying a certain property on a long-time payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient not only to pay your seller
14,null,null,but to reimburse you for your trouble
15,null,null,to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other things  allied properties
16,null,null,for instance
17,null,null,against which more bonds could be issued
18,null,null,and so on
19,null,null,ad infinitum
20,null,null,It became an old story later
21,null,null,but it was new at that time
22,null,null,and he kept the thought closely to himself
23,null,null,None the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this
24,null,null,since street railways were his hobby
25,happiness,convinced,and he was convinced that he would be a great master of them if he ever had an opportunity to control them .

1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,I just wanted to see how you danced
3,null,null,"   she said
4,null,null,tamely
5,null,null,the force of her original feeling having been weakened by a thought of what she was doing
6,happiness,smiled,He noted the change and smiled
7,null,null,It was lovely to be dancing with her
8,null,null,He had not thought mere dancing could hold such charm .
1271 15
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Cowperwood understood
2,null,null,He walked away
3,fear,nervous,He was quite warm and tense now almost nervous
4,null,null,It was quite clear to him that he had done or was contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing
5,null,null,Under the current code of society he had no right to do it
6,null,null,It was against the rules
7,null,null,as they were understood by everybody
8,null,null,Her father
9,null,null,for instance his father every one in this particular walk of life
10,null,null,However
11,null,null,much breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be
12,null,null,the rules were still there
13,null,null,As he had heard one young man remark once at school
14,null,null,when some story had been told of a boy leading a girl astray and to a disastrous end
15,null,null,"  That is n't the way at all .  "
1280 38
 (27, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident
3,null,null,in so many ways
4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then
18,null,null,O Heavens
19,null,null,the palaver
20,null,null,What beatings of tom-toms
21,null,null,What mouthings of pharisaical moralities platitudes
22,null,null,Run now
23,null,null,good people
24,null,null,for you may see clearly how evil is dealt with in high places
25,null,null,It made him smile
26,null,null,Such hypocrisy
27,anger,cant,Such cant
28,null,null,Still
29,null,null,so the world was organized
30,null,null,and it was not for him to set it right
31,null,null,Let it wag as it would
32,null,null,The thing for him to do was to get rich and hold his own to build up a seeming of virtue and dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing
33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit
35,null,null,And he had these
36,null,null,"  I satisfy myself
37,null,null,"   was his motto
38,null,null,and it might well have been emblazoned upon any coat of arms which he could have contrived to set forth his claim to intellectual and social nobility .
1284 11
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,And yet
2,null,null,as he had also learned
3,sadness,ashamed of,she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her
4,null,null,This irritated Cowperwood
5,null,null,as it would always irritate any strong
6,null,null,acquisitive
7,null,null,direct seeing temperament
8,null,null,While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings
9,null,null,why should there be concealment between them
10,null,null,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
11,null,null,Why do one thing and think another
1302 6
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,Things had changed considerably for him since the days when he had been fortuitously and almost indifferently made city treasurer
2,null,null,His method of dressing had so much improved since he had been inducted into office
3,happiness,good feeling,and his manner expressed so much more good feeling
4,null,null,confidence
5,null,null,aplomb
6,null,null,that he would not have recognized himself if he had been permitted to see himself as had those who had known him before .

3,null,null,oh

5,null,null,she was his
6,null,null,and he was hers

1,null,null,Cowperwood
2,null,null,Sr
3,null,null,was already plucking at his side whiskers in a confused and troubled way
4,null,null,He was cogitating as to what might happen to him in case his son failed
5,null,null,for he was deeply involved with him
6,null,null,He was a little gray in his complexion now
7,fear,frightened,frightened
8,null,null,for he had already strained many points in his affairs to accommodate his son
9,null,null,If Frank should not be able promptly on the morrow to meet the call which the bank might have to make for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
10,null,null,the onus and scandal of the situation would be on him .
1317 6
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,He was of a domestic turn of mind
2,null,null,Still
3,null,null,Sunday evening being an excellent one for conference purposes generally in the world of politics
4,null,null,he was not without the thought that some one or other of his distinguished confreres might call
5,null,null,and when the combination footman and butler announced the presence of Butler and his son
6,happiness,well pleased,he was well pleased .
1319 15
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,They were allied in no one particular financial proposition
2,null,null,any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were
3,null,null,And besides
4,null,null,in all probability Cowperwood was no fool
5,null,null,He was not equally guilty with Stener
6,null,null,the latter had loaned him money
7,null,null,The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues
8,null,null,but he decided not
9,null,null,Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind
10,fear,dangerous,It was a splendid chance but dangerous
11,null,null,He had better go it alone
12,null,null,For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could
13,null,null,If not
14,null,null,Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party
15,null,null,if need be .

1,null,null,"  Good God

6,null,null,"  Go ahead
7,null,null,See Mollenhauer
8,null,null,Let him tell you how to cut your own throat for his benefit
9,null,null,It wont be right to loan me three hundred thousand dollars more
10,null,null,but it will be right to let the five hundred thousand dollars you have loaned stand unprotected and lose it
11,null,null,That 's right
12,null,null,is n't it
13,null,null,That 's just what you propose to do lose it
14,null,null,and everything else besides

1729 9
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,However
2,sadness,painfully,the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident
3,null,null,for we had a visit from the afterguard in force one afternoon
4,null,null,and Abner with his brewage was haled to the quarter deck
5,null,null,There
6,null,null,in the presence of all hands
7,null,null,he was arraigned
8,null,null,found guilty of stealing the ship 's stores

3,null,null,slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat
4,null,null,jolting one of the oars
5,null,null,There was a gleam of light below as the school turned they had all disappeared instantly
6,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
7,null,null,but now
8,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
9,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
10,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
11,null,null,having been absent only two hours
12,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .

 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,null,null,and the three hundred fathoms of line
3,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
4,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
5,happiness,Happily,Happily
6,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
7,null,null,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
8,null,null,Meanwhile
9,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1773 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
2,null,null,but now
3,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings

7,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1775 7
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,He made a fearful to-do over it
2,null,null,rolling completely over several times backward and forward
3,null,null,at the same time smiting the sea with his mighty tail
4,null,null,making an almost deafening noise and pother
5,happiness,comfortable,But we were comfortable enough
6,null,null,while we un shipped the mast and made ready for action
7,null,null,being sufficiently far away from him to escape the full effect of his gambols .
1781 5
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,cheers,With hearty cheers from the whole population
2,null,null,we shoved off and ploughed through the kelp seaweed again
3,null,null,When we got clear of it
4,null,null,we found the swell heavier than when we had come
5,null,null,and a rough journey back to the ship was the result .
1789 13
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle
8,surprise,surprised,which they had surprised during his morning 's nap
9,null,null,One of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat 's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,diving deep
12,null,null,came up underneath him
13,null,null,seizing with crossed hands the two hind flippers .
1791 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Doubtless because he himself was much fatigued
2,null,null,the mate allowed him to run at his will
3,null,null,without for the time attempting to haul any closer to him
4,happiness,grateful,and very grateful the short rest was to us
5,null,null,But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water
6,null,null,coming up BEHIND us to rush off again in the opposite direction at undiminished speed .
1797 9
 (1, 4),
1,sadness,terrible,The terrible day wore on
2,null,null,without any lightening of the tempest
3,null,null,till noon

5,null,null,Until that time
6,null,null,the sea
7,null,null,although heavy
8,null,null,was not vicious or irregular
9,null,null,and we had not shipped any heavy water at all .
1802 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
2,surprise,astounding,For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding
3,null,null,Very few sailors have noticed the sickening condition of the ocean when the life-giving breeze totally fails for any length of time
4,null,null,or
5,null,null,if they have
6,null,null,they have said but little about it .
1810 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,they were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed
2,null,null,My democratic sentiments are deeply seated
3,null,null,but I do believe in authority
4,null,null,and respect for it being rigidly enforced
5,null,null,so this uncalled for scene upset me
6,fear,anxious,making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson
7,null,null,They got one .
1821 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When I recovered
2,null,null,I was snug in my bunk aboard
3,null,null,but aching in every joint
4,null,null,and as sore as if I had been pounded with a club until I was bruised all over
5,null,null,During the day Mr
6,happiness,kind,Count was kind enough to pay me a visit
7,null,null,With his usual luck
8,null,null,he had escaped without the slightest injury
1825 10
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,null,null,to our great joy
4,null,null,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,surprise,surprise,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .
1827 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thenceforward for another hour
2,null,null,in spite of all our efforts
3,null,null,we could not get within striking distance
4,null,null,mainly because of the close attention of the cow
5,null,null,which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother
6,disgust,impatient,I was getting so impatient of this hindrance
7,null,null,that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow
8,null,null,though I felt convinced that
9,null,null,if I did
10,null,null,I should spoil a good job .
1831 6
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,but then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related .
1856 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Rushing out of their house
2,null,null,they saw the heavens bespread with an awful pall of smoke
3,null,null,the underside of which was glowing with the reflected fires of some vast furnace
4,fear,terror,Their terror was increased by a smart shower of falling ashes and the reverberations of subterranean thunders
5,null,null,At first they thought of flight in their boat
6,null,null,not reckoning the wide stretch of sea which rolled between them and the nearest land
7,null,null,but the height and frequency of the breakers then prevailing made that impossible .
1871 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,dirtier
2,null,null,gloomier
3,null,null,and colder grew the weather
4,null,null,until
5,null,null,reduced to two topsails and a reefed foresail
6,null,null,we were scudding dead before the gale for all we were worth
7,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
8,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
9,null,null,To my mind
10,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
11,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1879 21
 (20, 19),
1,null,null,Oliver answered
2,null,null,"  He believes in Mr
3,null,null,Crocker
4,null,null,just as he believes in a lot of things that a good many people around here dont understand
5,null,null,He believes the time will come when they will value his pictures
6,null,null,and be proud to own them
7,null,null,But I dont care who owns mine
8,null,null,I just want the fun of painting them
9,null,null,Just think of what a man can do with a few tubes of color
10,null,null,a brush
11,null,null,and a bit of canvas
12,null,null,So I dont care if they never buy what I paint
13,null,null,I can get along somehow
14,null,null,just as Mr
15,null,null,Crocker does
16,null,null,He 's poor
17,null,null,but just see how happy he is
18,null,null,Why
19,null,null,when he does a good thing he 's nothing but a boy
20,happiness,glad,he 's so glad about it
21,null,null,I always know how his work has gone when I see his face .  "
1891 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Then Thorkill
2,null,null,seeing that they were of two minds
3,null,null,dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement
4,null,null,counselling them
5,null,null,to restrain themselves
6,null,null,and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter
7,happiness,delightful,albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold
8,null,null,to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear
9,null,null,neither to desire what was pleasant to take
10,null,null,nor dread what was awful to look upon
11,null,null,though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things .
1905 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .
1910 33
 (23, 2),
1,null,null,About a year later
2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person
10,null,null,not obstreperously so
11,null,null,but quietly and under the surface
12,null,null,Business was a great urge
13,null,null,He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars
14,null,null,Then this cold nine more days of pneumonia and he was dead
15,null,null,The shoe store was closed for a few days
16,null,null,the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people
17,null,null,There was a funeral
18,null,null,with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church
19,null,null,to which they belonged
20,null,null,and then he was buried
21,null,null,Mrs
22,null,null,Semple cried bitterly
23,sadness,in a depressed state,The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state
24,null,null,A brother of hers
25,null,null,David Wiggin
26,null,null,undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her
27,null,null,There was no will
28,null,null,but in the final adjustment
29,null,null,which included the sale of the shoe business
30,null,null,there being no desire on anybody 's part to contest her right to all the property
31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house
33,null,null,and was considered a charming and interesting widow .
1924 5
 (2, 1),(4, 1),
1,null,null,"  He should not have done so under any circumstances
2,anger,sternly,"   said his father sternly
3,null,null,to himself
4,anger,shocked,"  I am both surprised and shocked
5,null,null,and the punishment must be severe .  "
1932 10
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,All conversation was kept between the two queens
2,null,null,but her Wichwezi majesty had a platter of clay stone brought
3,null,null,which she ate with great relish
4,null,null,making a noise of satisfaction like a happy guinea pig
5,null,null,She threw me a bit
6,surprise,surprise,which to the surprise of everybody
7,null,null,I caught and threw it into my mouth
8,null,null,thinking it was some confection
9,null,null,but the harsh taste soon made me spit it out again
10,null,null,to the amusement of the company .
1942 14
 (13, 14),
1,null,null,Bruno thought about it
2,null,null,' well
3,null,null,I would n't like it if you were n't there
4,null,null,' he said
5,null,null,because that was the truth
6,null,null,' so you 'd prefer to stay here with me
7,null,null,i 'd prefer all four of us to stay together
8,null,null,' he said
9,null,null,reluctantly including Gretel in that
10,null,null,' whether that was in Berlin or out with
11,null,null,' oh
12,null,null,Bruno
13,anger,exasperated,' said Gretel in an exasperated voice
14,null,null,and he didnt know whether that was because he might be spoiling the plans for their return or because ( according to her ) he continued to mispronounce the name of their home .
1944 15
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
2,null,null,others sprang into the sea
3,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
4,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
5,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
6,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
7,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
8,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
9,null,null,now beaten this way
10,null,null,now that
11,sadness,despaired,and when night fell I despaired for my life
12,null,null,but
13,null,null,weary and spent as I was
14,null,null,I clung to my frail support
15,null,null,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island .
1953 16
 (14, 15),
1,null,null,He said the word ' home '
2,null,null,despite the fact that he wasnt sure where ' home ' was any more
3,null,null,' so I wont see you again
4,null,null,' asked Shmuel
5,null,null,' well
6,null,null,someday
7,null,null,yes

9,null,null,' you could come on a holiday to Berlin

13,null,null,' i suppose not
14,sadness,sadly,' he said sadly
15,null,null,' i wont have anyone to talk to any more when you 're gone
16,null,null,' he added .
1954 10
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,' no

3,null,null,He wanted to add the words
4,null,null,' i 'll miss you too
5,null,null,Shmuel
6,sadness,embarrassed,' to the sentence but found that he was a little embarrassed to say them
7,null,null,' so tomorrow will be the last time we see each other until then
8,null,null,' he continued
9,null,null,' we 'll have to say our goodbyes then
10,null,null,i 'll try to bring you an extra special treat . '
1960 15
 (15, 3),
1,null,null,' hello
2,null,null,Bruno
3,null,null,' he said when he saw his friend approaching
4,null,null,' hello

6,null,null,' said Bruno
7,null,null,' i wasnt sure if we 'd ever see each other again with the rain and everything
8,null,null,I mean
9,null,null,' said Shmuel
10,null,null,' i thought you might be kept indoors
11,null,null,' it was touch and go for a while
12,null,null,' said Bruno
13,null,null,' what with the weather being so bad
14,null,null,Shmuel nodded and held out his hands to Bruno
15,happiness,opened his mouth in delight,who opened his mouth in delight .
1964 5
 (4, 3),(4, 4),
1,null,null,Shmuel reached down and lifted the base of the fence
2,null,null,but it only lifted to a certain height and Bruno had no choice but to roll under it
3,null,null,getting his striped pyjamas completely covered in mud as he did so
4,happiness,laughed,He laughed when he looked down at himself
5,null,null,He had never been so filthy in all his life and it felt wonderful .
1973 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,' ssh

3,null,null,putting a finger to his lips
4,null,null,dont say anything or they get angry
5,surprise,frowned,Bruno frowned but was relieved that all the people in striped pyjamas from this part of the camp were gathering together now
6,null,null,most of them being pushed together by the soldiers
7,null,null,so that he and Shmuel were hidden in the centre of them and could n't be seen .

2006 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Scarlett had no awe of her father and felt him more her contemporary than her sisters

 (13, 13),
1,null,null,Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice
2,null,null,as she went hunting about
3,null,null,and called out to her in an angry tone
4,null,null,Why
5,null,null,Mary Ann
6,null,null,what ARE you doing out here
7,null,null,Run home this moment
8,null,null,and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
9,null,null,Quick
10,null,null,now
11,null,null,' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to
12,null,null,without trying to explain the mistake it had made He took me for his housemaid
13,surprise,surprised,' she said to herself as she ran How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am
14,null,null,But i 'd better take him his fan and gloves that is
15,null,null,if I can find them
16,null,null,As she said this
17,null,null,she came upon a neat little house
18,null,null,on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  WRABBIT engraved upon it . She went in without knocking
19,null,null,and hurried upstairs
20,null,null,in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
21,null,null,and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves
2053 30
 (7, 8),
1,null,null,An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes
2,null,null,and feebly stretching out one paw
3,null,null,trying to touch her Poor little thing
4,null,null,' said Alice
5,null,null,in a coaxing tone
6,null,null,and she tried hard to whistle to it
7,fear,frightened,but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
8,null,null,in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did
9,null,null,she picked up a little bit of stick
10,null,null,and held it out to the puppy
11,null,null,whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
12,null,null,with a yelp of delight
13,null,null,and rushed at the stick
14,null,null,and made believe to worry it
15,null,null,then Alice dodged behind a great thistle
16,null,null,to keep herself from being run over
17,null,null,and the moment she appeared on the other side
18,null,null,the puppy made another rush at the stick
19,null,null,and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
20,null,null,then Alice
21,null,null,thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse
22,null,null,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet
23,null,null,ran round the thistle again
24,null,null,then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
25,null,null,running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
26,null,null,and barking hoarsely all the while
27,null,null,till at last it sat down a good way off
28,null,null,panting
29,null,null,with its tongue hanging out of its mouth
30,null,null,and its great eyes half shut .
2077 23
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,There was an eager pressing round to hear
2,null,null,and not only were Lilias and Malcolm
3,null,null,but old Sir David himself
4,null,null,much affected by the strain
5,null,null,which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III
6,null,null,which
7,null,null,sad as they were
8,null,null,now seemed like good old times
9,null,null,so much worse was the present state of affairs
10,null,null,Sir James
11,null,null,however
12,fear,anxious,seemed anxious to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung
13,null,null,and applied to Malcolm to give a specimen of his powers :   and thus
14,null,null,with music
15,null,null,ballad
16,null,null,and lay
17,null,null,the evening passed away
18,null,null,till the parting cup was sent round
19,null,null,and the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep
20,null,null,in a wainscoted box bedstead
21,null,null,and his two attendant squires
22,null,null,a great iron gray Scot and a rosy honest faced Englishman
23,null,null,on pallets on the floor .

 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,And for all Malcolm 's anxiety for his uncle
2,null,null,his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self respect .
2097 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Would she be there
2,fear,anxiety,That was the chief anxiety :   for it was not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on the Continent
3,null,null,and Catherine had given no intimation as to who would be in her suite so that
4,null,null,as Henry had merrily observed
5,null,null,he was the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense
6,null,null,except indeed Salisbury
7,null,null,who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come out with the Queen .

2112 35
 (31, 29),(31, 30),
1,null,null,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy
2,null,null,summoned Sir Nigel to his side
3,null,null,closed his own visor
4,null,null,and called for water
5,null,null,then hung over the prisoner
6,null,null,anxious to prevent the first word from being broad Scotch
7,null,null,In the free air
8,null,null,some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life
9,null,null,and James at once said
10,null,null,' rendez vous
11,null,null,My Lord
12,null,null,' but he neither answered
13,null,null,nor was there meaning in his eyes
14,null,null,And James perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs
15,null,null,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,null,null,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms
17,null,null,He swooned again at the first attempt to lift him
18,null,null,and a hay cart having been left in the flight of the marauders
19,null,null,he was laid in it
20,null,null,and covered with the King 's cloak
21,null,null,to be conveyed to Corbeil
22,null,null,where James trusted to secure his life by personal intercession with Henry
23,null,null,He groaned heavily several times
24,null,null,but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way
25,null,null,and James and Sir Nigel kept on either side of the cart
26,null,null,ready to address him in French the first moment
27,null,null,having told the English that he was a prisoner of quality
28,null,null,who must be carefully conveyed to King James 's tent at Corbeil
29,null,null,Malcolm was not allowed to approach
30,null,null,lest he should be recognized
31,sadness,in an agony of shame and suspense,and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense
32,null,null,with very different feelings towards Patrick than those with which he had of late thought of him
33,null,null,or of his own promises
34,null,null,If Patrick died through this plundering raid
35,null,null,how should he ever face Lily

 (6, 7),
1,null,null,And this was Christina 's charge
2,null,null,whom she must look upon as the least alien spirit in this dreadful castle of banishment
3,null,null,The young and old lords seemed to her savage bandits
4,null,null,who frightened her only less than did the proud sinister expression of the old lady
5,null,null,for she had not even the merit of showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl
6,sadness,ashamed,of whom she was ashamed
7,null,null,and evidently regarded the town bred attendant as a contemptible interloper .

9,null,null,a great bear 's hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth
10,null,null,and cushions were made of these skins
11,null,null,and stuffed from Ursel 's stores of feathers

13,null,null,who had never been made of so much importance
14,surprise,surprised,and was as much surprised as relieved by such attentions
15,null,null,She was too young and too delicate to reject civilization
16,null,null,and she let Christina braid her hair
