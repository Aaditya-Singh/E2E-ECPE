1,null,null,The slave in this new position finds himself much better off than he ever was in his life before
2,null,null,with this exception
3,null,null,that as a slave he feels himself much degraded in the social scale of society
4,null,null,and his family ties are all cut off from him probably his relations have all been killed in the war in which he was captured
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,after the first qualms have worn off
7,null,null,we find him much attached to his master
8,null,null,who feeds him and finds him in clothes in return for the menial services which he performs
9,null,null,In a few years after capture
10,happiness,confidence,or when  confidence has been gained by the attachment shown by the slave
11,null,null,if the master is a trader in ivory

8,null,null,dispersed
9,fear,feared,and feared to come near his musket again

1,null,null,These two slaves

5,fear,terror,They laughed at the stories I told them of the terror that had seized Baraka and all the Wanguana

8,null,null,that those men
9,null,null,especially Baraka
10,null,null,had from their first leaving Kaze made up their minds they would not enter Usui
11,null,null,or go anywhere very far north .
154 25
 (19, 20),
1,null,null,With at last a sufficiency of porters
2,null,null,we all set out together
3,null,null,walking over a new style of country
4,null,null,Instead of the constantly recurring outcrops of granite
5,null,null,as in Unyamuezi
6,null,null,with valleys between
7,null,null,there were only two lines of little hills visible
8,null,null,one right and one left of us
9,null,null,a good way off
10,null,null,whilst the ground over which we were travelling
11,null,null,instead of being confined like a valley
12,null,null,rose in long high swells of sandstone formation
13,null,null,covered with small forest trees
14,null,null,among which flowers like primroses
15,null,null,only very much larger
16,null,null,and mostly of a pink colour
17,null,null,were frequently met with
18,null,null,Indeed
19,happiness,happy,we ought all to have been happy together
20,null,null,for all my men were paid and rationed trebly far better than they would have been if they had been travelling with any one else
21,null,null,but I had not paid all
22,null,null,as they thought
23,null,null,proportion ably
24,null,null,and therefore there were constant heart burnings
25,null,null,with strikes and rows every day .
155 12
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,Here some of the porters
2,null,null,attempting to bolt
3,null,null,were intercepted by my coast men and had a fight of it
4,null,null,for they fired arrows
5,null,null,and in return the coast men cut their bows
6,null,null,The whole camp
7,null,null,of course
8,null,null,was in a blaze at this
9,null,null,their tribe was insulted
10,disgust,not stand it,and they would not stand it
11,null,null,until Bombay put down their pride with a few strings of beads
12,null,null,as the best means of restoring peace in the camp .

1,happiness,Happily,Happily no one tried to pillage us here
2,null,null,so on we went to Vikora 's

5,null,null,under a sandstone hill
6,null,null,faced with a dyke of white quartz
7,null,null,over which leaped a small stream of water a seventy feet drop which

2,null,null,but were killed by the natives
3,null,null,I now assured Rumanika that in two or three years he would have a greater trade with Egypt than he ever could have with Zanzibar
4,null,null,for when I opened the road
5,null,null,all those men he heard of would swarm up here to visit him
6,null,null,however
7,sadness,laughed,only laughed at my folly in proposing to go to a place of which all I heard was merely that every stranger who went there was killed
171 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,after ordering all the seizures to be given up to Maula on behalf of the king
2,null,null,and threatening to discharge any of my men who dared retain one item of the property
3,null,null,I shut the door of my hut to do penance for two days
4,null,null,giving orders that nobody but my cook Ilmas
5,null,null,not even Bombay
6,null,null,should come near me
7,null,null,for the king had caused my men to sin had disgraced their red cloth and had inflicted on me a greater insult than I could bear
8,sadness,ashamed,I was ashamed to show my face
9,null,null,Just as the door was closed
10,null,null,other pages from the king brought the Whitworth rifle to be cleaned

2,surprise,surprised,I was even more surprised to find the unusual ceremonies that awaited me

5,null,null,Men
6,null,null,women
7,null,null,bulls
8,null,null,dogs
9,null,null,and goats
10,null,null,were led about by strings
11,null,null,cocks and hens were carried in men 's arms
12,null,null,and little pages
13,null,null,with rope turbans
14,null,null,rushed about
15,null,null,conveying messages
16,null,null,as if their lives depended on their swiftness
17,null,null,every one holding his skin cloak tightly round him lest his naked legs might by accident be shown .
180 22
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,The king acknowledged the truthfulness of their story
2,null,null,saying he had heard the same himself
3,null,null,and both Wakungu
4,null,null,as is the custom in Uganda
5,happiness,enthusiastic,thanked their lord in a very enthusiastic manner
6,null,null,kneeling on the ground for no one can stand in the presence of his majesty in an attitude of prayer
7,null,null,and throwing out their hands as they repeated the words N'yanzig
8,null,null,N'yanzig
9,null,null,ai N'yanzig Mkahma wangi
10,null,null,etc
11,null,null,etc
12,null,null,for a considerable time
13,null,null,when
14,null,null,thinking they had done enough of this
15,null,null,and heated with the exertion
16,null,null,they threw themselves flat upon their stomachs
17,null,null,and
18,null,null,floundering about like fish on land
19,null,null,repeated the same words over again and again
20,null,null,and rose doing the same
21,null,null,with their faces covered with earth
22,null,null,for majesty in Uganda is never satisfied till subjects have groveled before it like the most abject worms .
183 13
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Here I heard
2,null,null,in an adjoining court
3,null,null,the boisterous
4,null,null,explosive laughs of both mother and son royal shouts loud enough to be heard a mile off
5,happiness,pleased,and inform the community that their sovereigns were pleased to indulge in hilarity
6,null,null,Immediately afterwards
7,null,null,the gate between us being thrown open
8,null,null,the king
9,null,null,like a very child
10,null,null,stood before us

12,null,null,in public
13,null,null,in what Europeans would call clothes .
190 8
 (5, 5),(7, 5),
1,null,null,I now asked permission to speak with him on some important matters
2,null,null,when he sent his women away and listened
3,null,null,I said I felt anxious about the road on which Mabruki was travelling
4,null,null,to which I added that I had ordered him to tell Petherick to come here or else to send property to the value of one thousand dollars
5,fear,anxious,and I felt anxious because some of the queen 's officers felt doubtful about Waganda being able to penetrate Kidi
6,null,null,He said I need not concern myself on that score
7,fear,anxious,he was much more anxious for the white men to come here than even I was
8,null,null,and he would not send my men into any danger

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There was no time to think
2,fear,fear,my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann

203 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion
2,null,null,Then he turned and walked away very slowly
3,disgust,shame,as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat
4,null,null,The young man flung away the fence rail
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers
7,null,null,he strode past me into the tavern
8,null,null,his anger still hot .
207 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,For a while the tune held its mad pace
2,null,null,and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note
3,null,null,for Zeron had broken a string
4,null,null,Amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room I saw Nick stop before an open window in which a prying Indian was framed
5,null,null,swing Suzanne at arm 's length
6,fear,startled him into life,and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life .

3,null,null,as he circled around us in a mimic war dance
4,surprise,in astonishment,And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment
5,null,null,and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing
6,null,null,For the back woodsmen were children of nature
7,null,null,Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain
8,null,null,and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played   Billy of the Wild Woods and   Jump Juba
9,null,null,'' with all his might
10,null,null,and the pine knots threw their fitful
11,null,null,red light on the wild scenes of merriment
12,null,null,I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance
13,null,null,for presently Colonel Clark came up to us
14,null,null,laughing in his quiet way .
229 6

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday
2,null,null,Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country
3,fear,feared,and Chupin feared he might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements
4,null,null,And while running to the Place de la Bourse
5,null,null,he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate
6,null,null,deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says :   "  It is not always well to tell the whole truth .  "
259 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The frightened housekeeper struggled with all her might
2,null,null,trying her best to reach the little gate which was standing open

 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Overcome by a flood of recollections
2,happiness,tears sprang to his eyes,the tears sprang to his eyes
3,null,null,He embraced his mother
4,null,null,and fled precipitately from the house .

 (4, 5),
1,null,null,The sun was just flooding the slopes when our guest arose to leave

278 3
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,At that he bent back his head and laughed
2,anger,anger,which made me redden with anger
3,null,null,Then he turned and looked at me more soberly .

1,null,null,He could see again his fingers
2,null,null,bloody
3,null,null,but un shaking
4,null,null,handing the old doctor a needle and silk cord
5,surprise,surprise,He remembered his surprise and pity
6,null,null,almost contempt
7,null,null,for big Tom Magee lying on the floor unable to lift his head
8,null,null,remembered
9,null,null,too
10,null,null,the strange absence of anything like elation at the doctor 's words
11,null,null,"  My boy
12,null,null,you have the nerve and the fingers of a surgeon
13,null,null,and that 's what your Maker intended you to be .  "

3,surprise,surprise,My surprise reached a climax
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System
6,null,null,That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to me to be such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it .

1,sadness,despair,When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair
2,null,null,If I  can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments

3,null,null,asked a clear but rather harsh voice
4,null,null,We could not hear the servant  s reply
5,null,null,but the door closed
6,null,null,and someone began to ascend the stairs
7,null,null,The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one
8,surprise,surprise,A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it
9,null,null,It came slowly along the passage

2,null,null,My son is on leave just now
3,null,null,but I did not tell him anything of all this
4,null,null,for his temper is violent

 (5, 4),
1,null,null,"  I can certainly discover the necessary pretext here
2,null,null,"   he murmured
3,null,null,rummaging through the mass of papers
4,null,null,But he did not at once find what he sought
5,disgust,impatient,and he was growing impatient
6,null,null,as could be seen by his feverish haste
7,null,null,when all at once he paused with a sigh of relief
8,null,null,"  At last
403 11
 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's countenance wore an expression of profound commiseration
2,null,null,A looker on would have supposed him interested and sympathetic to the last degree
3,null,null,but in reality
4,null,null,he was furious
5,null,null,Time was passing
6,null,null,and the conversation was wandering farther and farther from the object of his visit
7,surprise,surprised,"  I am surprised
8,null,null,madame
9,null,null,"   said he
10,null,null,"  that you never applied to your former employer

411 9
 (6, 9),
1,null,null,Fortunat would certainly have preferred to lose a good pound of flesh rather than the sum of money mentioned

6,disgust,embarrassment,his embarrassment was extreme
7,null,null,"  It was the most unfortunate thing in the world

 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's embarrassment was really painful to witness
2,null,null,He was not usually wanting in courage
3,null,null,but the events of the evening had shaken his confidence and his composure
4,null,null,The hope of gain and the fear of loss had deprived him of his wanted clearness of mind
5,null,null,Feeling that he had just committed a terrible blunder
6,null,null,he racked his brain to find some way of repairing it
7,null,null,and finding none
8,sadness,confusion,his confusion increased .
413 14
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,He took them
2,null,null,without even asking the mother if she had enough left to purchase her dinner that evening

5,null,null,thought the banker 's conduct perfectly natural and just
6,null,null,It is true that Madame d' argeles was in despair during forty-eight hours or so

9,null,null,Not at all
10,null,null,however
11,null,null,on the contrary
12,null,null,she had good cause to congratulate herself upon the notoriety she gained through this suicide
13,null,null,For five days she was the talk of Paris

2,null,null,given in a certain fashion
3,null,null,never fail to produce an effect diametrically opposed to that which they seemingly aim at

2,null,null,Her little escape into the streets
3,null,null,her posting of the letter
4,null,null,had been followed so immediately by Uncle Mathew 's visit

2,null,null,and as they went a funny little incident occurred
3,happiness,happy,They were both too happy to talk and Maggie was too happy even to think
4,null,null,Suddenly she was aware that some one was coming towards her whom she knew
5,null,null,She looked and tugged herself from that world of Martin and only Martin in which she was immersed .

5,null,null,and if you are n't careful i 'll report you that 's what i 'll do

1,null,null,And that other life began to be dim and faint even Martin was a little hidden and mysterious
2,happiness,glad,Strangely she was glad of that
3,null,null,the only way that this could be carried through was by keeping the other out of it
4,null,null,Would the two worlds mingle
5,null,null,Would the faces and voices of those spirits be seen and heard again

1,null,null,"  The king
2,null,null,her father
3,null,null,has carefully shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze
4,null,null,and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband
5,null,null,But in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before
6,null,null,The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal
7,null,null,the second of bronze
8,null,null,the third of fine steel
9,null,null,the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze
10,null,null,the fifth of touchstone
11,null,null,the sixth of silver
12,null,null,and the seventh of solid gold
13,null,null,They are all most sumptuously furnished
14,null,null,whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste
15,null,null,In fact
16,null,null,neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess
17,null,null,The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide
18,null,null,and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage
19,null,null,The king has always received these embassies graciously
20,null,null,but says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will
21,null,null,and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal
22,sadness,disappointed,the envoys have had to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were gratified by their magnificent receptions .

13,null,null,and loves you with all her soul
14,null,null,But I shall pay no more heed to my mother-in-law 's words than I did to those of the women
15,null,null,Again she will beseech me to listen to her entreaties
16,null,null,throwing herself this time at my feet
17,null,null,but all to no purpose
18,null,null,Then
19,null,null,putting a glass of wine into my wife 's hand
20,null,null,she will say to her
21,null,null,"  There
22,null,null,present that to him yourself
23,null,null,he cannot have the cruelty to reject anything offered by so beautiful a hand
24,null,null,"   and my wife will take it and offer it to me trembling with tears in her eyes
25,null,null,but I shall look in the other direction
26,null,null,This will cause her to weep still more
27,null,null,and she will hold out the glass crying

29,null,null,never shall I cease my prayers till you have done me the favour to drink
30,null,null,Sick of her importune ties
31,anger,fury,these words will goad me to fury
32,null,null,I shall dart an angry look at her and give her a sharp blow on the cheek
33,null,null,at the same time giving her a kick so violent that she will stagger across the room and fall on to the sofa .

1,null,null,With that he supplied me with provisions
2,null,null,and bade me farewell
3,null,null,and I set out with my new companions
4,null,null,I soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts
5,null,null,but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks
6,null,null,I did not at all understand how we were to do it
7,null,null,The crowns of the cocoa palms were all alive with monkeys
8,null,null,big and little
9,null,null,which skipped from one to the other with surprising agility
10,null,null,seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance
11,null,null,and I was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures
12,null,null,which seemed to me quite harmless
13,null,null,But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily
14,null,null,for the monkeys
15,anger,annoyed,annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin
16,null,null,began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful gestures
17,null,null,so that after very little labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained .

1,sadness,despair,TSo saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with misery and despair
2,null,null,Just at this moment a servant came out of the palace
3,null,null,and taking him by the arm said

1,null,null,As will be imagined
2,surprise,surprise,these words took the Sultan by surprise
3,null,null,and he looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess
4,null,null,As I was unable to speak
5,null,null,I placed my hand on my head to show that it was true .

 (11, 11),
1,null,null,One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess
2,null,null,his daughter
3,null,null,went to and from the bath
4,null,null,Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face
5,null,null,which was very difficult
6,null,null,as she always went veiled
7,null,null,He hid himself behind the door of the bath
8,null,null,and peeped through a chink
9,null,null,The princess lifted her veil as she went in
10,null,null,and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight
11,fear,frightened,He went home so changed that his mother was frightened
12,null,null,He told her he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her
13,null,null,and meant to ask her in marriage of her father
14,null,null,His mother
15,null,null,on hearing this
16,null,null,burst out laughing
17,null,null,but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request
18,null,null,She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden
19,null,null,which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels
20,null,null,She took these with her to please the Sultan
21,null,null,and set out
22,null,null,trusting in the lamp
23,null,null,The grand vizir and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan
24,null,null,He
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,took no notice of her
27,null,null,She went every day for a week
28,null,null,and stood in the same place .

7,null,null,There was something easy and sufficient about him
8,null,null,He did not appear to be in the least flustered or disturbed

1,null,null,The Watermans
2,null,null,Henry and George
3,null,null,were greatly pleased with the way he handled their accounts
4,null,null,There was a sense of security in his very presence
5,null,null,He soon began to call Brother George 's attention to the condition of certain accounts
6,null,null,making suggestions as to their possible liquidation or discontinuance
7,happiness,pleased,which pleased that individual greatly
8,null,null,He saw a way of lightening his own labors through the intelligence of this youth
9,null,null,while at the same time developing a sense of pleasant companionship with him .
1221 16
 (10, 11),
1,null,null,He had gone through a real period of strain when Frank
2,null,null,Jr
3,null,null,was born
4,null,null,for Mrs
5,null,null,Cowperwood was frightened
6,null,null,He feared for the beauty of her body troubled over the danger of losing her
7,null,null,and he actually endured his first worry when he stood outside the door the day the child came
8,null,null,Not much he was too self sufficient
9,null,null,too resourceful
10,fear,worried,and yet he worried
11,null,null,conjuring up thoughts of death and the end of their present state
12,null,null,Then word came
13,null,null,after certain piercing
14,null,null,harrowing cries
15,null,null,that all was well
16,null,null,and he was permitted to look at the new arrival .

4,null,null,but
5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him
8,null,null,So he had gone his way day by day
9,null,null,watching the coming in and the departing of troops
10,null,null,seeing the bands of dirty
11,null,null,disheveled
12,null,null,gaunt
13,null,null,sickly men returning from the fields and hospitals
14,null,null,and all he could do was to feel sorry
15,null,null,This war was not for him
16,null,null,He had taken no part in it
17,null,null,and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in its conclusion not as a patriot

1,null,null,"  Cowperwood
2,null,null,"   he said to him the first morning he ever broached this matter it was in Stener 's office
3,null,null,at the old city hall at Sixth and Chestnut

5,null,null,in view of his oncoming prosperity
6,happiness,feeling very good indeed,was feeling very good indeed  "  is n't there some street railway property around town here that a man could buy in on and get control of if he had sufficient money

3,null,null,Seneca Davis
4,null,null,and still later with Mrs
5,null,null,Martyn Walker
6,null,null,Cowperwood had occasion to look at Aileen often
7,happiness,a sense of great vigor,and each time that he did so there swept over him a sense of great vigor there
8,null,null,of beautiful if raw
9,null,null,dynamic energy that to him was irresistible and especially so to-night
10,null,null,She was so young
11,null,null,She was beautiful
12,null,null,this girl
13,null,null,and in spite of his wife 's repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his clear
14,null,null,aggressive
15,null,null,unblinking attitude than any one whom he had yet seen in the form of woman .
1267 9
 (9, 6),(9, 8),
1,null,null,She lifted shy eyes to him now
2,null,null,for
3,null,null,in spite of her gay
4,null,null,aggressive force she was afraid of him
5,null,null,His personality was obviously so dominating
6,null,null,Now that he was so close to her
7,null,null,dancing
8,null,null,she conceived of him as something quite wonderful
9,fear,nervous,and yet she experienced a nervous reaction a momentary desire to run away .

1,null,null,That the modern home is the most beautiful of schemes
2,null,null,when based upon mutual sympathy and understanding between two
3,null,null,need not be questioned
4,null,null,And yet this fact should not necessarily carry with it a condemnation of all love not so fortunate as to find so happy a denouement
5,null,null,Life cannot be put into any mold
6,null,null,and the attempt might as well be abandoned at once
7,happiness,fortunate,Those so fortunate as to find harmonious companionship for life should congratulate themselves and strive to be worthy of it
8,null,null,Those not so blessed
9,null,null,though they be written down as pariahs

1,null,null,However
2,null,null,by the spring and summer of 1871
3,null,null,Cowperwood had actually
4,null,null,without being in any conceivable danger from any source
5,null,null,spread himself out very thin
6,null,null,Because of his great success he had grown more liberal easier in his financial ventures
7,null,null,By degrees
8,null,null,and largely because of his own confidence in himself
9,null,null,he had induced his father to enter upon his street car speculations
10,null,null,to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary
11,null,null,In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical

2,happiness,dauntless,so the spears Of dauntless Danaans strewed the earth with slain
3,null,null,for loyal to dead Achilles were they all
4,null,null,And loyal to hero Aias to the death  .  For like black Doom he blasted the ranks of Troy .
1552 7
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,Yet victory gladdened not his heart In that great struggle for achilles ' prizes
2,null,null,Nay
3,null,null,swift albeit he was

7,null,null,for that the fiery flying of his feet Still won him second place .
1559 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Anguished he fell Upon the dead
2,null,null,outpouring many a tear More comfort lessly than the orphan babe That wails beside the hearth
3,null,null,with ashes strewn On head and shoulders
4,sadness,wails,wails bereavement 's day That brings death to the mother who hath nursed The fatherless child .
1565 4
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,cheer,So spake he words of cheer :  the godlike kings Gathered with heavy hearts around the dead
2,null,null,And many hands up heaved the giant corpse
3,null,null,And swiftly bare him to the ships
4,null,null,and there Washed they away the blood that clotted lay dust flecked on mighty limbs and armour .
1571 3
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,fear,grimly,Thereon were seen two serpents flickering Black tongues from grimly jaws :  they seemed in act To dart
2,null,null,but hercules ' hands to right and left   Albeit a babe 's hands   now were throttling them
3,null,null,For awe less was his spirit .
1579 11
 (10, 11),
1,null,null,Yet had their might Availed not for defence
2,null,null,for all their will
3,null,null,Had Teucer and Idomeneus strong of heart Come not to help

2,null,null,mid piteous shrieks
3,null,null,A fearful serpent hath devoured

 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Verily all The Argives had beside their ships been slain
2,null,null,Had not achilles ' strong son on that day Withstood the host of foes and their great chief Eurypylus Came to that young hero 's side Phoenix the old

4,fear,fear,ushed with fear were all their hearts Foreboding doom
5,null,null,for like a huge cloud seemed That throng of foes :  with clashing arms they came :  Volumed and vast the dust rose ' neath their feet .
1629 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,All trembled as they prayed for husbands
2,null,null,sons
3,null,null,And brothers :  white haired sires amidst them sat

1,null,null,The mother forgat her child

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,All his heaviness of cheer And misery vanished by the immortals ' will
2,happiness,glad,And glad at heart were all that looked on him
3,null,null,And from affliction he awoke to joy
4,null,null,Over the bloodless face the flush of health Glowed
5,null,null,and for wretched weakness mighty strength Thrilled through him :  goodly and great waxed all his limbs .

1,sadness,distresses,The distresses of the young couple at this period were subjects of pleasant reflexion during their prosperity as recorded in the Diary
2,null,null,25th February
3,null,null,1667 .
1666 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Then I

4,null,null,Crewe 's
5,null,null,in our way talking of publick things
6,fear,feared,He told me he feared there was new design hatching
7,null,null,as if Monk had a mind to get into the saddle .
1676 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,It fell very well to-day
2,null,null,a stranger preached here for Mr
3,null,null,Ibbot
4,null,null,one Mr
5,null,null,Stanley
6,null,null,who prayed for King Charles
7,null,null,by the Grace of God
8,null,null,&c
9,happiness,great contentment,which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on board here
10,null,null,and they said they would talk of it
11,null,null,when they come to Breda
12,null,null,as not having it done yet in London so publicly .
1684 5
 (2, 2),(4, 2),
1,null,null,I was much troubled
2,fear,fear,for fear of being forced to pay the money myself
3,null,null,Called at my father 's going home
4,fear,mourning,and bespoke mourning for myself
5,null,null,for the death of the Duke of Gloucester .
1694 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,pains,The greatest pains were afterwards taken to preserve the fortress
2,null,null,and a fine Mole was constructed
3,null,null,at a vast expense
4,null,null,to improve the harbour .
1701 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The spoilers see and quake
2,null,null,no more think they Of feasting
3,fear,panic,but they turn in panic flight Huddling :  fast follow at their heels the hounds Biting remorselessly .

 (1, 1),
1,anger,frenzy,They are in frenzy of pain Start from the furrow
2,null,null,and sore disquieted The hind is for marred work
3,null,null,and for their sake
4,null,null,Lest perhaps the recoiling ploughshare light On their leg sinews .
1708 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,feared,He feared lest she Might slay him even beyond his doom

1715 12
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Achaea 's lords of might
2,null,null,exceeding fain Safe to win home
3,null,null,made this their offering For safe return

5,null,null,And to this story shall he stand
6,null,null,How long whatsoever they question him
7,null,null,until
8,null,null,Though never so relentless
9,null,null,they believe
10,null,null,And drag it
11,null,null,their own doom
12,null,null,within the town .
1719 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Some Whose waists the lance had pierced
2,null,null,impaling them Where sharpest stings the anguish laden steel . And all about the city dolorous howls Of dogs up rose
3,sadness,miserable,and miserable moans Of strong men stricken to death
4,null,null,and every home With awful cries was echoing Rang the shrieks Of women .
1732 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1739 7
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done
2,sadness,pity,It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo
3,null,null,and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee
4,null,null,Next day
5,null,null,and for a whole week after
6,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
7,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner .  "
1740 1
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,astounding,For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding .
1754 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
2,null,null,for never a spout did we see
3,happiness,delight,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
4,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time
5,null,null,Determined to have a big catch
6,null,null,if possible
7,null,null,we lowered all five boats
8,null,null,as it was a beautifully calm day
9,null,null,and the ship might almost safely have been left to look after herself .
1755 8
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,But then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related
7,null,null,When the highly dangerous nature of the work is remembered
8,null,null,this statement may seem somewhat overdrawn
1759 10
 (8, 6),
1,null,null,While the final touch was being given to our task i
2,null,null,the hole boring through the tail fin all hands lay around in various picturesque attitudes
3,null,null,enjoying a refreshing smoke
4,null,null,care forgetting
5,null,null,While thus pleasantly employed
6,null,null,sudden death
7,null,null,like a bolt from the blue
8,sadness,terrible,leapt into our midst in a terrible form
9,null,null,The skipper was labouring hard at his task of cutting the hole for the tow line
10,null,null,when without warning the great fin swung back as if suddenly released from tremendous tension .
1777 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Anyhow
2,null,null,I could haul this piece alongside now
3,null,null,if I liked
4,null,null,and see
5,surprise,wondering,Secretly wondering at the indifference shown by this officer of forty years whaling experience to such a wonderful fact as appeared to be here presented
6,null,null,I thanked him
7,null,null,and
8,null,null,sticking the boat hook into the lump
9,null,null,drew it alongside .
1784 6
 (3, 3),(3, 6),
1,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
2,null,null,as I have before noted
3,disgust,resented,but I was perfectly well aware that the slightest attempt on my part to show that I resented our common treatment would meet with the most brutal repression
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,in addition
6,null,null,I might look for a dreadful time of it for the rest of the voyage .
1803 14
 (9, 9),(9, 10),
1,null,null,A light breeze then sprang up
2,null,null,aided by which we crept around Achin Head
3,null,null,the northern point of the great island of Sumatra
4,null,null,Like some gigantic beacon
5,null,null,the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene
6,null,null,Pulo Way
7,null,null,or Water Island
8,null,null,looked very inviting
9,happiness,glad,and I should have been glad to visit a place so well known to seamen by sight
10,null,null,but so little known by actual touching at
11,null,null,Our recent stay at the Cocos
12,null,null,however
13,null,null,had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative
14,null,null,unless we might be compelled by accident
1824 10
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,happiness,joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,null,null,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .
1827 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thenceforward for another hour
2,null,null,in spite of all our efforts
3,null,null,we could not get within striking distance
4,null,null,mainly because of the close attention of the cow
5,null,null,which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother
6,disgust,impatient,I was getting so impatient of this hindrance
7,null,null,that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow
8,null,null,though I felt convinced that
9,null,null,if I did
10,null,null,I should spoil a good job .
1830 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Such a weary time was ours for full four weeks after sighting Christmas Island
2,sadness,exhausted,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
3,null,null,for never a spout did we see
4,null,null,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
5,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time .
1839 9
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,For unto us a Child is born
2,null,null,unto us a Son is given "   again and again billows and billows of glory
3,null,null,I gasped for breath
4,null,null,shook like one in an ague fit
5,null,null,the tears ran down in a continuous stream
6,surprise,amazed,while people stared amazed at me
7,null,null,thinking
8,null,null,I suppose
9,null,null,that I was another drunken sailor .
1844 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,That being settled
2,null,null,we anchored the boat
3,null,null,and lit pipes
4,null,null,preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances
5,disgust,troubling,the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf
6,null,null,Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light
7,null,null,shed in the wake of no ordinary sized fish
8,null,null,probably an immense shark .
1864 9
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,His crew
2,null,null,on the impulse of the moment
3,null,null,sprang to the rail and cheered with might and main
4,null,null,No one could gainsay that they had good reason
5,fear,feared,but I really feared for a time that we should have  "  ructions
6,null,null,"   As Paddy said
7,null,null,it was not wise or dignified for those officers to be so angry with him on account of his success
8,null,null,which he frankly owned was due almost entirely to the local knowledge he possessed
9,null,null,gained in many years study of the immediate neighbourhood .
1867 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Satisfied that our days in the southern hemisphere were numbered
2,null,null,and all anxiety to point her head for home
3,happiness,pleasing,this news was most pleasing
4,null,null,putting all of us in the best of humours
5,null,null,and provoking quite an entertainment of song and dance until nearly four bells .
1875 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I left her only a moment ago she and her husband wanted me to take supper with them at Riley 's the new restaurant on University Place
2,null,null,you know
3,null,null,famous for its devilled crabs
4,happiness,like,But I always like to come here for my clams
5,null,null,Allow me a moment  "   and he bent over the steaming tub
6,null,null,and skewering the contents of a pair of shells with his iron fork held it out toward Oliver .
1881 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Frode was thus forced to quit the wars of the East and fought a great battle in Sweden with his sister Swanhwid
2,null,null,in which he was beaten
3,null,null,So he got on board a skiff
4,null,null,and sailed stealthily in a circuit
5,null,null,seeking some way of boring through the enemy 's fleet
6,surprise,surprised,When surprised by his sister and asked why he was rowing silently and following divers meandering courses
7,null,null,he cut short her inquiry by a similar question
1885 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,If thou refuse thy daughter
2,happiness,pleased,consent to fight :  thou must needs grant one thing or the other We wish either to die or to have our prayers beard Something   sorrow if not joy   we will get from thee Frode will be better pleased to hear of our slaughter than of our repulse
3,null,null,Without another word
4,null,null,he threatened to aim a blow at the king 's throat with his sword The king replied that it was unseemly for the royal majesty to meet an inferior in rank in level combat
5,null,null,and unfit that those of unequal station should fight as equals .
1891 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Then Thorkill
2,null,null,seeing that they were of two minds
3,null,null,dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement
4,null,null,counselling them
5,null,null,to restrain themselves
6,null,null,and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter
7,happiness,delightful,albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold
8,null,null,to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear
9,null,null,neither to desire what was pleasant to take
10,null,null,nor dread what was awful to look upon
11,null,null,though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things .
1906 8
 (5, 1),(5, 4),
1,null,null,This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight
2,null,null,for my cows were eaten up
3,null,null,and my men clamouring incessantly for food
4,null,null,and though they might by orders help themselves  "  ku n'yangania "   by seizing from the Waganda
5,sadness,hurt,it hurt my feelings so much to witness this
6,null,null,that I tried from the first to dispense with it
7,null,null,telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing
8,null,null,and now he turned them into a pack of thieves .
1913 18
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Either the well was very deep
2,null,null,or she fell very slowly
3,null,null,for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next  .  First
4,null,null,she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to
5,null,null,but it was too dark to see anything
6,null,null,then she looked at the sides of the well
7,null,null,and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves
8,null,null,here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed
9,null,null,it was labelled  ' ORANGE MARMALADE '
10,fear,fear,but to her great disappointment it was empty :  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody
11,null,null,so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  Well
12,null,null,' thought Alice to herself
13,null,null,after such a fall as this
14,null,null,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
15,null,null,How brave they 'll all think me at home
16,null,null,Why
17,null,null,I would n't say anything about it
18,null,null,even if I fell off the top of the house
1919 7
 (7, 2),
1,null,null,Suddenly
2,null,null,a ferocious looking beast sprang out of the bush
3,null,null,He was wearing fine silk clothes and roared
4,null,null," I gave you food and a bed to sleep in
5,null,null,And now
6,null,null,you are stealing my roses
7,fear,frightened,"  The merchant was frightened and told the Beast about Beauty 's gift .
1937 6
 (1, 2),(1, 3),
1,happiness,determined,He felt quite determined
2,null,null,as he walked away
3,null,null,never in his life to go near her
4,null,null,She was perhaps a human being
5,null,null,but Creston ought n't  to have shown her without precautions
6,null,null,ought n't indeed to have  shown her at all .
1945 7
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,The prince could hardly believe his ears
2,null,null,and rode off as hard as he could
3,null,null,He found his way
4,null,null,and arrived safe and sound at his father 's house
5,null,null,where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grand vizir 's carelessness
6,anger,angry,The king was very angry
7,null,null,and had him strangled immediately .
1954 10
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,' no
2,null,null,' said Bruno
3,null,null,He wanted to add the words
4,null,null,' i 'll miss you too
5,null,null,Shmuel
6,sadness,embarrassed,' to the sentence but found that he was a little embarrassed to say them
7,null,null,' so tomorrow will be the last time we see each other until then
8,null,null,' he continued
9,null,null,' we 'll have to say our goodbyes then
10,null,null,i 'll try to bring you an extra special treat . '
1965 5
 (5, 3),(5, 5),
1,null,null,Shmuel reached down and lifted the base of the fence
2,null,null,but it only lifted to a certain height and Bruno had no choice but to roll under it
3,null,null,getting his striped pyjamas completely covered in mud as he did so
4,null,null,He laughed when he looked down at himself
