1,null,null,So Woolard happily granted Jobs 's wish
2,null,null,with a Gulfstream V
3,null,null,and also offered him fourteen million stock options
4,null,null,Jobs gave an unexpected response
5,null,null,He wanted more :  twenty million options
6,fear,upset,Woolard was baffled and upset .
95 2
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,am pleased to,So I am pleased to announce today that im going to drop the interim title
2,null,null,he said with a big smile .
96 3
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,The most Zen of all simplicities was Jobs 's decree
2,surprise,astonished,which astonished his colleagues
3,null,null,that the iPod would not have an on-off switch .
97 7
 (1, 2),(1, 3),
1,fear,nervous,I was really   nervous
2,null,null,because he was one of my heroes
3,null,null,And I was also afraid that he   would n't be really smart anymore
4,null,null,that he 'd be a caricature of himself
5,null,null,like   happens to a lot of people
6,null,null,But I was delighted
7,null,null,He was as sharp as a tack .
98 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,we 're both a bit drunk
2,happiness,happy,and we 're happy with this wonderful iPod and I cant even believe it exists and im holding it in my hand
3,null,null,Thank you
99 9
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,But as soon as they checked in
2,null,null,he braced himself
3,null,null,and sure enough his phone rang a minute later
4,null,null,I hate my room
5,null,null,Jobs declared
6,null,null,It 's a piece of shit
7,null,null,let 's go
8,null,null,So Ive gathered his luggage and went to the front desk
9,surprise,shocked,where Jobs bluntly told the shocked clerk what he thought .
100 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Bewkes didnt agree with any of those premises
2,happiness,happy,He said he was happy for Apple to sell digital subscriptions for Time Inc
3,null,null,Apple 's 30% take was not the problem
4,null,null,im telling you right now
5,null,null,if you sell a sub for us
6,null,null,you can have 30%
7,null,null,Bewkes told him .
101 2
 (1, 1),
1,fear,scared,They are scared to death
2,null,null,because they know they are guilty
102 4
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,What did he think of the suggestion that Apple sometimes acted arrogantly
2,fear,worried about,im not worried about that
3,null,null,he said
4,null,null,because we 're not arrogant .
103 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,worried,Powell worried that her husband would again cancel
2,null,null,so she was thrilled when the whole family took off in early July for Kona Village
3,null,null,Hawaii
4,null,null,which was the first leg of the trip .

 (5, 4),
1,null,null,During this expedition Speke reached the most southerly point of the lake
2,null,null,and gave it its present name
3,null,null,Speke arrived back in England in the spring of 1859
4,null,null,Burton being left behind on account of his illness
5,sadness,strained,The relations between the two had become strained
6,null,null,and this was accentuated by Speke 's hast to publish the account of his explorations
7,null,null,He was given the command of another expedition which left England in April 1860
8,null,null,in company with Captain James Augustus Grant
9,null,null,to ascertain still further if the Victoria Nyanza were indeed the source of the Nile .
105 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,The district chief is absolute
2,null,null,though guided in great measure by his  "  grey beards
3,null,null,"   who constantly attend his residence
4,null,null,and talk over their affairs of state
5,null,null,These commonly concern petty internal matters
6,disgust,selfish,for they are too selfish and too narrow-minded to care for anything but their own private concerns
7,null,null,The grey beards circulate the orders of the chief amongst the village chiefs
8,null,null,who are fined when they do not comply with them
9,null,null,and hence all orders are pretty well obeyed .
106 9
 (8, 1),
1,null,null,Their young women go naked
2,null,null,but the mothers suspend a little tail both before and behind
3,null,null,As the hair of the negro will not grow long
4,null,null,a barber might be dispensed with
5,null,null,were it not that they delight in odd fashions
6,null,null,and are therefore continually either shaving it off altogether
7,null,null,or else fashioning it after the most whimsical designs
8,disgust,proud,No people in the world are so proud and headstrong as the negroes

108 7
 (7, 6),(7, 7),
1,null,null,Lines of traffic are the worst tracks ( there are no roads in the districts here referred to ) for a traveller to go upon
2,null,null,not only because the hospitality of the people has been damped by frequent communication with travellers
3,null,null,but
4,null,null,by intercourse with the semi civilised merchant
5,null,null,their natural honour and honesty are corrupted
6,null,null,their cupidity is increased
7,surprise,frighten,and the show of firearms ceases to frighten them .
109 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,and judging from the progressive state of the world
2,null,null,one is led to suppose that the African must soon either step out from his darkness
3,null,null,or be superseded by a being superior to himself
4,null,null,Could a government be formed for them like ours in India
5,null,null,they would be saved
6,null,null,but without it
7,fear,fear,I fear there is very little chance
8,null,null,for at present the African neither can help himself nor will he be helped about by others
9,null,null,because his country is in such a constant state of turmoil he has too much anxiety on hand looking out for his food to think of anything else

7,null,null,As his fathers ever did
8,null,null,so does he
9,null,null,He works his wife
10,null,null,sells his children
11,null,null,enslaves all he can lay hands upon
12,null,null,and
13,null,null,unless when fighting for the property of others
14,null,null,contents himself with drinking
15,null,null,singing
16,null,null,and dancing like a baboon to drive dull care away .
111 13
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,The slave in this new position finds himself much better off than he ever was in his life before
2,null,null,with this exception
3,null,null,that as a slave he feels himself much degraded in the social scale of society
4,null,null,and his family ties are all cut off from him probably his relations have all been killed in the war in which he was captured
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,after the first qualms have worn off
7,null,null,we find him much attached to his master
8,null,null,who feeds him and finds him in clothes in return for the menial services which he performs
9,null,null,In a few years after capture
10,happiness,confidence,or when  confidence has been gained by the attachment shown by the slave
11,null,null,if the master is a trader in ivory

10,null,null,but should the master die
11,null,null,according to the Mohammedan creed the slaves ought to be freed
12,null,null,In Arabia this would be the case
13,null,null,but at Zanzibar it more generally happens that the slave is willed to his successor .
113 15
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,on the march he is no better
2,null,null,If you give him a gun and some ammunition to protect him in case of emergencies
3,null,null,he will promise to save it
4,null,null,but forthwith expends it by firing it off in the air
5,null,null,and demands more
6,surprise,fear,else he will fear to venture amongst the  "  savages
7,null,null,Suppose you give him a box of bottles to carry
8,null,null,or a desk
9,null,null,or anything else that requires great care
10,null,null,and you caution him of its contents
11,null,null,the first thing he does is to commence swinging it round and round
12,null,null,or putting it topsy-turvy on the top of his head
13,null,null,when he will run off at a jog trot
14,null,null,singing and laughing in the most provoking manner
15,null,null,and thinking no more about it than if it were an old stone
114 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,On the 17th
2,null,null,after the anchor was cast
3,null,null,without a moment 's delay I went off to the British Consulate to see my old friend Colonel Rigby
4,happiness,delighted,He was delighted to see us
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,in anticipation of our arrival
7,null,null,had prepared rooms for our reception
8,null,null,that both Captain Grant and myself might enjoy his hospitality until arrangements could be made for our final start into the interior .
115 8
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,To call on the Sultan
2,null,null,of course
3,null,null,was our first duty
4,null,null,He received us in his usually affable manner
5,null,null,made many trite remarks concerning our plans
6,surprise,surprised,was surprised
7,null,null,if my only object in view was to see the great river running out of the lake
8,null,null,that I did not go by the more direct route across the Masai country and Usoga
116 6
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Colonel Rigby
2,null,null,who had at heart as much as anybody the success of the expedition
3,null,null,materially assisted me in accomplishing my object that men accustomed to discipline and a knowledge of English honour and honesty should be enlisted
4,happiness,confidence,to give confidence to the rest of the men
5,null,null,and he allowed me to select from his boat 's crew any men I could find who had served as men-of-war
6,null,null,and had seen active service in India .
117 12
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,On my return to Zanzibar
2,null,null,the Brisk sailed for the Mauritius
3,null,null,but fortune sent Grant and myself on a different cruise
4,null,null,Sultan Majid
5,null,null,having heard that a slaver was lying at Pangani
6,happiness,anxious,and being anxious to show his good faith with the English
7,null,null,begged me to take command of one his vessels of war and run it down
8,null,null,Accordingly
9,null,null,embarking at noon
10,null,null,as soon as the vessel could be got ready
11,null,null,we lay to that night at Tombat
12,null,null,with a view of surprising the slaver next morning
118 13
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,We had a brave crew of young negroes to pull us
2,null,null,but
3,null,null,pull as they would
4,fear,feared,the current was so strong that we feared
5,null,null,if we persisted
6,null,null,we should be drawn into the broad Indian Ocean
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,changing our line
9,null,null,we bore into the little coralline island
10,null,null,Maziwa
11,null,null,where
12,null,null,after riding over some ugly coral surfs
13,null,null,we put in for the night .
119 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,but a few soft words were found sufficient to make them all withdraw and settle the matter at issue by arbitration in some appointed place
2,happiness,fearlessly,A few men without property can cross their lands fearlessly
3,null,null,though a single individual with property would stand no chance
4,null,null,for they are insatiable thieves
5,null,null,But little is seen of these people on the journey
6,null,null,as the chiefs take their taxes by deputy
7,null,null,partly out of pride
8,null,null,and partly because they think they can extort more by keeping in the mysterious distance .
120 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,They both knew Hindustani
2,null,null,but while Rahan 's services at sea had been short
3,happiness,intelligent,Baraka had served nearly all his life with Englishmen was the smartest and most intelligent negro I ever saw was invaluable to Colonel Rigby as a detector of slave traders
4,null,null,and enjoyed his confidence completely so much so
5,null,null,that he said
6,null,null,on parting with him
7,null,null,that he did not know where he should be able to find another man to fill his post .

122 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,wo taxes in five miles was a thing unheard of
2,null,null,and I heard no more about the matter
3,null,null,until Bombay in the evening told me how Sheikh Said
4,fear,fearing,fearing awkward consequences
5,null,null,had settled to give two dubuani
6,null,null,one being taken from his own store
7,null,null,Lion 's Claw also turned up again
8,null,null,getting his cloths of yesterday one more being added from the Sheikh 's stores and he was then advised to go off quietly
9,null,null,as I was a fire eater whom nobody dared approach after my orders had been issued .
123 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A very welcome packet of quinine and other medicines reached us here from Rigby
2,null,null,who
3,null,null,hearing our complaints that the Hottentots could only be kept alive by daily potions of brandy and quinine
4,fear,feared,feared our supplies were not enough
5,null,null,and sent us more .
124 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,At the advice of Musa
2,sadness,sorry,I sent Maula 's son off at night to tell the old chief how sorry I was to find the Arabs so hot-headed I could not even effect an arrangement with them
3,null,null,It was a great pity
4,null,null,for Manua Sera was so much liked by the Wanyamuezi
5,null,null,they would
6,null,null,had they been able
7,null,null,have done anything to restore him .

126 16
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Next day the non belligerent Arabs left in charge of the station
2,null,null,headed by my old friends Abdulla and Mohinna
3,null,null,came to pay their respects again
4,null,null,recognising in me
5,null,null,as they said
6,null,null,a  "  personification of their sultan
7,null,null,"   and therefore considering what they were doing only due to my rank
8,sadness,regretted,They regretted with myself that Snay was so hot-headed
9,null,null,for they themselves thought a treaty of peace would have been the best thing for them
10,null,null,for they were more than half ruined already
11,null,null,and saw no hope for the future
12,null,null,Then
13,null,null,turning to geography
14,null,null,I told Abdulla all I had written and lectured in England concerning his stories about navigators on the N'yanza
15,null,null,which I explained must be the Nile
16,null,null,and wished to know if I should alter it in any way :
127 13
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,27th and 28th
2,null,null,I now gave all my men presents for the severe trials they had experienced in the wilderness
3,null,null,forgetting
4,null,null,as I told them
5,null,null,the merciless manner in which they had plundered me
6,null,null,but as I have a trifle more in proportion
7,null,null,to the three sole remaining pagazis
8,null,null,because they had not finished their work
9,disgust,discontented,my men were all discontented
10,null,null,and wished to throw back their presents
11,null,null,saying I did not love them
12,null,null,although they were  "  permanents
13,null,null,"   as much as the  "  temporaries .  "
128 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Days rolled on
2,null,null,and nothing was done in particular  beyond increasing my stock of knowledge of distant places and people
3,null,null,enlarging my zoological collection
4,null,null,and taking long series of astronomical observations until the 13th
5,sadness,depressed,when the whole of Kaze was depressed by a sad scene of mourning and tears
6,null,null,Some slaves came in that night having made their way through the woods from Ugogo
7,null,null,avoiding the track to save themselves from detection  and gave information that Snay
8,null,null,Jafu
9,null,null,and five other Arabs
10,null,null,had been killed
11,null,null,as well as a great number of slaves .
129 8
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,The Arabs
2,sadness,grief,after the first burst of their grief was over
3,null,null,came to me again in a body
4,null,null,and begged me to assist them
5,null,null,for they were utterly undone
6,null,null,Manua Sera prevented their direct communication with their detachment at Mdaburu
7,null,null,and that again was cut off from their caravans at Kanyenye by the Mzanza people
8,null,null,and in fact all the Wagogo
130 15
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,Her old mistress
2,null,null,she said
3,null,null,died well stricken in years
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,as she had succeeded her
6,null,null,the people of her country invited Singinya to marry her
7,null,null,because feuds had arisen about the rights of succession
8,null,null,and it was better a prince
9,null,null,whom they thought best suited by birth and good qualities
10,null,null,should head their warriors
11,null,null,and keep all in order
12,null,null,At that moment Singinya was out in the field fighting his enemies
13,null,null,and she was sure
14,null,null,when he heard I was here
15,sadness,sorry,that he would be very sorry he had missed seeing me .
131 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,He used to trade in ivory
2,null,null,on account of some Arabs at Zanzibar
3,null,null,On crossing Usui
4,null,null,he once had a fight with one of the chiefs of the country and killed him
5,null,null,but he got through all right
6,null,null,because the natives
7,null,null,after two or three of their number had been killed
8,null,null,dispersed
9,fear,feared,and feared to come near his musket again
10,null,null,He visited Uganda when the late king Sunna was living
11,null,null,and even traded Usoga
132 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Adding a little advice of his own
2,null,null,Sheikh Said pressed me to go on with the journey as fast as possible
3,disgust,accused,because all the Arabs had accused me of conspiring with Manua Sera
4,null,null,and would turn against me unless I soon got away .
133 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,He was a fine looking young man
2,null,null,about thirty years old
3,null,null,the husband of thirty wives
4,null,null,but he had only three children
5,surprise,surprised,Much surprised at the various articles composing our kit
6,null,null,he remarked that our  "  sleeping clothes "   blankets were much better than his royal robes
7,null,null,but of all things that amused him most were our picture books
8,null,null,especially some birds drawn by Wolf .
134 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,after being humbugged so many times by his procrastination
2,null,null,I gave Sheikh Said more letters and specimens
3,null,null,with orders to take the Tots down to the coast as soon as practicable
4,null,null,and started once more for the north
5,null,null,expecting very shortly to hear of Musa 's death
6,null,null,though he promised to follow me the very next day or die in the attempt
7,null,null,and he also said he would bring on the four men required by Suwarora
8,happiness,satisfied,for I was fully satisfied in my mind that he would have marched with me then had he had the resolution to do so at all .
135 9
 (3, 3),(5, 3),
1,null,null,but they came and went in the most tantalising manner
2,null,null,notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give
3,sadness,worse and worse,Every day seemed to be worse and worse
4,null,null,Some of Musa 's men came to get palm toddy for him
5,sadness,weak,as he was too weak  to stand
6,null,null,and was so cold nothing would warm him
7,null,null,There was
8,null,null,however
9,null,null,no message brought for myself
136 8
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,suffer,My patience was beginning to suffer again
2,null,null,for I could not help thinking that the chiefs of the place were preventing their village men going with me in order that my presence here might ward of the Watuta
3,null,null,so I called up the kirangozi
4,null,null,who had thirteen  "  Watoto
5,null,null,"   as they are called
6,null,null,or children of his own
7,null,null,wishing to go
8,null,null,and asked him if he knew why no other men could be got .
137 8
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,amused,My men had greatly amused him by firing their guns off and showing him the use of their sword bayonets
2,null,null,I knew
3,null,null,as a matter of course
4,null,null,that if I stopped any longer I should be teased for more cloths
5,null,null,and gave orders to my men to march the same instant
6,null,null,saying
7,null,null,if they did not for I saw them hesitate I would give the cows to the villagers
8,null,null,since I knew that was the thing that weighed on their minds .
138 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,This provoked fresh squabbles
2,null,null,The drums had beaten and the tax was settled
3,null,null,I could not pay more
4,null,null,The kirangozi
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,said he would not move a peg unless I gave something more
7,null,null,else he would be seized on his way back
8,null,null,His  "  children all said the same
9,sadness,worsted,and as I thought Grant would only be worsted if I did not keep friends with the scoundrel
10,null,null,I gave four yards more merikani
11,null,null,and then went on my way .
139 10
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,At length giving in
2,null,null,I entered Ruhe 's boma
3,null,null,the poles of which were decked with the skulls of his enemies stuck upon them
4,null,null,Instead
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,of seeing him myself
7,fear,feared,as he feared my evil eye
8,null,null,I conducted the arrangements for the hongo through Baraka
9,null,null,in the same way as I did at M'yonga 's
10,null,null,directing that it should be limited to the small sum of one barsati and four yards kiniki .
140 11
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,This was too provoking
2,fear,worry,The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever
3,null,null,and had made me feel quite sick
4,null,null,so I said
5,null,null,if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifer s again
6,null,null,I would fight the matter out with him
7,null,null,for I had not come there to be bullied
8,null,null,He then gave way
9,null,null,and begged I would allow my men to fire a volley outside his boma
10,null,null,as the Watuta were living behind a small line of granitic hills flanking the west of his district
11,null,null,and he wished to show them what a powerful force he had got with him .
141 13
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,I then told the Pig and Baraka to settle at once
2,null,null,They no sooner did so than the drums beat
3,null,null,and Makaka
4,happiness,humour,in the best humour possible
5,null,null,came over to say I had permission to go when I liked
6,null,null,but he hoped I would give him a gun and a box of lucifer s
7,null,null,This was too provoking
8,null,null,The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever
9,null,null,and had made me feel quite sick
10,null,null,so I said
11,null,null,if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifer ss again
12,null,null,I would fight the matter out with him
13,null,null,for I had not come there to be bullied .
142 11
 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Whilst engaged in this operation
2,null,null,Baraka
3,null,null,accompanied by Wadimoyo ( Heart ' s-stream )
4,null,null,another of my freeman
5,null,null,approached me in great consternation
6,null,null,whispering to themselves
7,fear,fearful,They said they had some fearful news to communicate
8,null,null,which
9,null,null,when I heard it
10,null,null,they knew would deter our progress :  it was of such great moment and magnitude
11,null,null,they thought they could not deliver it then .
143 9
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then Baraka said
2,null,null,"  I have just heard from Makaka
3,anger,angry,that a man who arrived from Usui only a few minutes ago has said Suwarora is so angry with the Arabs that he has detained one caravan of theirs in his country
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,separating the whole of their men
6,null,null,has placed each of them in different bomas
7,null,null,with orders to his village officers that
8,null,null,in case the Watuta came into his country
9,null,null,without further ceremony they were to be all put to death .  "
144 14
 (14, 14),
1,null,null,This was a fearful drain on my store
2,null,null,but the Pig
3,null,null,seeing my concern
4,null,null,merely laughed at it
5,null,null,and said
6,null,null,"  Oh
7,null,null,these savage chiefs are all alike here
8,null,null,you will have one of these taxes to pay every stage to Uyofu
9,null,null,and then the heavy work will begin
10,null,null,for all these men
11,null,null,although they assume the dignity of chief to themselves
12,null,null,are mere officers
13,null,null,who have to pay tribute to Suwarora
14,anger,angry,and he would be angry if they were shortcoming .  "
145 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,These two slaves
2,null,null,both of whom knew all the chiefs and languages up to and including Uganda
3,null,null,promised me faithfully they would go with Bombay on to Usui
4,null,null,and bring back porters in sufficient number for Grant and myself to go on together
5,fear,terror,They laughed at the stories I told them of the terror that had seized Baraka and all the Wanguana
6,null,null,and told me
7,null,null,as old Musa had often done before
8,null,null,that those men
9,null,null,especially Baraka
10,null,null,had from their first leaving Kaze made up their minds they would not enter Usui
11,null,null,or go anywhere very far north .
146 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Then turning to the animals
2,null,null,he roared over each one in turn as he examined them
3,null,null,and called out their names
4,null,null,My bull ' s-eye lantern he coveted so much
5,anger,anger,I had to pretend exceeding anger to stop his further importune ties
6,null,null,He then began again begging for lucifer s
7,null,null,which charmed him so intensely I thought I should never get rid of him .
147 8
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,whilst in the valley there were not only magnificent trees of extraordinary height
2,null,null,but also a surprising amount of the richest cultivation
3,null,null,amongst which the banana may be said to prevail
4,null,null,Notwithstanding this apparent richness in the land
5,null,null,the Wanyambo
6,null,null,living in their small squalid huts
7,disgust,poor,seem poor
8,null,null,The tobacco they smoke is imported from the coffee growing country of Uhaiya .
148 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Leaving the valley of Uthenga
2,null,null,we rose over the spur of N'yamwara
3,null,null,where we found we had attained the delightful altitude of 5000 odd feet
4,null,null,Oh
5,null,null,how we enjoyed it
6,happiness,happy,every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika
7,null,null,Tripping down the greensward
8,null,null,we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley
9,null,null,and pitched our tents in the village .
149 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,Leaving the valley of Uthenga
2,null,null,we rose over the spur of N'yamwara
3,null,null,where we found we had attained the delightful altitude of 5000 odd feet
4,null,null,Oh
5,happiness,enjoyed,how we enjoyed it
6,null,null,every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika
7,null,null,Tripping down the greensward
8,null,null,we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley
9,null,null,and pitched our tents in the village .
150 10
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,the real facts of the case were these though I did not find them out at the time :   Baraka had bought some slaves with my effects
3,null,null,and he had had a fight with some of my men because they tampered with his temporary wife a princess he had picked up in Phunze
4,null,null,To obtain her hand he had given ten necklaces of MY beads to her mother
5,null,null,and had agreed to the condition that he should keep the girl during the journey
6,null,null,and after it was over
7,null,null,and he took her home
8,null,null,he would
9,happiness,pleased,if his wife pleased him
10,null,null,give her mother ten necklaces more .
151 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Ever anxious to push on with the journey
2,null,null,as I felt every day 's delay only tended to diminish my means that is
3,null,null,my beads and copper wire I instructed Bombay to take the under mentioned articles to Rumanika as a small sample of the products of my country
4,sadness,ashamed,to say I felt quite ashamed of their being so few and so poor
5,null,null,but I hoped he would forgive my shortcomings
6,null,null,as he knew I had been so often robbed on the way to him
7,null,null,and I trusted
8,null,null,in recollection of Musa
9,null,null,he would give me leave to go on to Uganda
10,null,null,for every day 's delay was consuming my supplies .
152 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Next morning
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,on seeing me actually preparing to start
4,null,null,Lumeresi found he could not let me go until I increased the tax by three more cloths
5,disgust,complained,as some of his family complained that they had got nothing
6,null,null,After some badgering
7,null,null,I paid what he asked for
8,null,null,and ordered the men to carry me out of the palace before anything else was done
9,null,null,for I would not sleep another night where I was .
153 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Neither his father nor any of his forefathers had had such a great favour shown them
2,null,null,He was alarmed
3,null,null,he confessed
4,null,null,when he heard we were coming to visit him
5,null,null,thinking we might prove some fearful monsters that were not quite human
6,happiness,delighted,but now he was delighted beyond all measure with what he saw of us
7,null,null,A messenger should be sent at once to the king of Uganda to inform him of our intention to visit him
8,null,null,with his own favourable report of us .
154 25
 (19, 20),
1,null,null,With at last a sufficiency of porters
2,null,null,we all set out together
3,null,null,walking over a new style of country
4,null,null,Instead of the constantly recurring outcrops of granite
5,null,null,as in Unyamuezi
6,null,null,with valleys between
7,null,null,there were only two lines of little hills visible
8,null,null,one right and one left of us
9,null,null,a good way off
10,null,null,whilst the ground over which we were travelling
11,null,null,instead of being confined like a valley
12,null,null,rose in long high swells of sandstone formation
13,null,null,covered with small forest trees
14,null,null,among which flowers like primroses
15,null,null,only very much larger
16,null,null,and mostly of a pink colour
17,null,null,were frequently met with
18,null,null,Indeed
19,happiness,happy,we ought all to have been happy together
20,null,null,for all my men were paid and rationed trebly far better than they would have been if they had been travelling with any one else
21,null,null,but I had not paid all
22,null,null,as they thought
23,null,null,proportion ably
24,null,null,and therefore there were constant heart burnings
25,null,null,with strikes and rows every day .
155 12
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,Here some of the porters
2,null,null,attempting to bolt
3,null,null,were intercepted by my coast men and had a fight of it
4,null,null,for they fired arrows
5,null,null,and in return the coast men cut their bows
6,null,null,The whole camp
7,null,null,of course
8,null,null,was in a blaze at this
9,null,null,their tribe was insulted
10,disgust,not stand it,and they would not stand it
11,null,null,until Bombay put down their pride with a few strings of beads
12,null,null,as the best means of restoring peace in the camp .
156 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,At this place we were visited by the chief of the district
2,null,null,Pongo ( bush boc )
3,null,null,who had left his palace to see us and invite us his way
4,fear,feared,for he feared we might give him the slip by going west into Uyofu
5,null,null,He sent us a cow
6,null,null,and said he should like some return
7,null,null,for Masudi
8,null,null,who had gone ahead
9,null,null,only gave him a trifle
10,null,null,professing to be our vanguard
11,null,null,and telling him that as soon as we came with the large caravan we would satisfy him to his heart 's content .
157 12
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,It was given
2,null,null,after many angry words
3,null,null,but it was the old story over again  he would have one more wire and a cloth
4,null,null,or else he would not allow us to proceed on the morrow
5,null,null,My men
6,anger,provoked,this time really provoked
7,null,null,said they would fight it out
8,null,null,a king breaking his word in that way
9,null,null,But in the end the demand had to be paid
10,null,null,and at last
11,null,null,at 9 P
12,null,null,the drums beat the satisfaction .
158 10
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,Happily,Happily no one tried to pillage us here
2,null,null,so on we went to Vikora 's
3,null,null,another officer
4,null,null,living at N'yakasenye
5,null,null,under a sandstone hill
6,null,null,faced with a dyke of white quartz
7,null,null,over which leaped a small stream of water a seventy feet drop which
8,null,null,it is said
9,null,null,Suwarora sometimes paid homage to when the land was oppressed by drought
10,null,null,Vikora 's father it was whom Sirboko of Mininga shot .
159 13
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,excitement,Just then Bombay returned flushed with the excitement of a great success
2,null,null,He had been in Masudi 's camp
3,null,null,and had delivered my message to Insangez
4,null,null,Asudi
5,null,null,he said
6,null,null,had been there a fortnight unable to settle his hongo
7,null,null,for the great Mkama had not deigned to see him
8,null,null,though the Arab had been daily to his palace requesting an interview
9,null,null,"  Well
10,null,null,"   I said
11,null,null,"  that is all very interesting
12,null,null,but what next
13,null,null,will the big king see us
160 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,On leaving this interesting place
2,null,null,with the widespread information of all the surrounding countries I had gained
3,null,null,my mind was so impressed with the topographical features of all this part of Africa
4,null,null,that in my heart I resolved I would make Rumanika as happy as he had made me
5,null,null,and asked K'yengo his doctor
6,null,null,of all things I possessed what the king would like best
7,surprise,surprise,To my surprise I then learnt that Rumanika had set his heart on the revolving rifle I had brought for Mtesa the one
8,null,null,in fact
9,null,null,which he had prevented my sending on to Uganda in the hands of Kachuchu
10,null,null,and he would have begged me for it before had his high-minded dignity
11,null,null,and the principle he had established of never begging for anything
12,null,null,not interfered .
161 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The flatterers said
2,null,null,"  It is as clear as possible
3,happiness,pleased,God gave the thunderbolt to Dagaro as a sign he was pleased with him and his rule
4,null,null,but when he found two brothers contending
5,null,null,he withdrew it to show their conduct was wicked .  "
162 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Before breaking up
2,null,null,Rumanika wished to give me any number of ivories I might like to mention
3,null,null,even three or four hundred
4,happiness,honour,as a lasting remembrance that I had done him the honour of visiting Karague in his lifetime
5,null,null,for though Dagara had given to coloured merchants
6,null,null,he would be the first who had given to a white man
7,null,null,Of course this royal offer was declined with politeness
163 9
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,he must understand that it was not the custom of big men in my country to accept presents of value when we made visits of pleasure
2,null,null,I had enjoyed my residence in Karague
3,null,null,his intellectual conversations and his kind hospitality
4,null,null,all of which I should record in my books to hand down to posterity
5,null,null,but if he would give me a cow 's horn
6,happiness,happy,I would keep it as a trophy of the happy days I had spent in his country
7,null,null,He gave me one
8,null,null,measuring 3 feet 5 inches in length
9,null,null,and 18 3/4 inches in circumference at the base .
164 16
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,n a minute or two afterwards
2,null,null,the good young princes
3,null,null,attracted by the sound of the gun
4,null,null,came to see what was done
5,surprise,surprise,Their surprise knew no bounds
6,null,null,they could scarcely believe what they saw
7,null,null,and then
8,null,null,on recovering
9,null,null,with the spirit of true gentlemen
10,null,null,they seized both my hands
11,null,null,congratulating me on the magnitude of my success
12,null,null,and pointed out
13,null,null,as an example of it
14,null,null,a bystander who showed fearful scars
15,null,null,both on his abdomen and at the blade of his shoulder
16,null,null,who they declared had been run through by one of these animals .
165 17
 (15, 17),
1,null,null,heir surprise knew no bounds
2,null,null,they could scarcely believe what they saw
3,null,null,and then
4,null,null,on recovering
5,null,null,with the spirit of true gentlemen
6,null,null,they seized both my hands
7,null,null,congratulating me on the magnitude of my success
8,null,null,and pointed out
9,null,null,as an example of it
10,null,null,a bystander who showed fearful scars
11,null,null,both on his abdomen and at the blade of his shoulder
12,null,null,who they declared had been run through by one of these animals
13,null,null,It was
14,null,null,therefore
15,happiness,wonderful,wonderful to them
16,null,null,they observed
17,null,null,with what calmness I went up to such formidable beasts .
166 12
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,accused,In the evening we had another row with my head men Baraka having accused Bombay of trying to kill him with magic
2,null,null,Bombay
3,null,null,who was so incessantly bullied by Baraka 's officious attempts to form party cliques opposed to the interests of the journey
4,null,null,and get him turned out of the camp
5,null,null,indiscreetly went to one of K'yengo 's men
6,null,null,and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would affect the hearts of the Wanguana so as to incline them towards him
7,null,null,and on the sub doctor saying Yes
8,null,null,Bombay gave him some beads
9,null,null,and bought the medicine required
10,null,null,which
11,null,null,put into a pot of pombe
12,null,null,was placed by Baraka 's side .
167 14
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,The princes then
2,null,null,thinking me  "  green "   at this kind of sport
3,null,null,said the place was enchanted
4,null,null,but I need not fear
5,null,null,for they would bring them out to my feet by simply calling out certain names
6,null,null,and this was no sooner done than four old and one young one came immediately in font of us
7,null,null,It seemed quite a sin to touch them
8,sadness,innocent,they looked all so innocent
9,null,null,but as the king wanted to try me again
10,null,null,I gave one a ball on the head which sent him under
11,null,null,never again to be seen
12,null,null,for on the 22nd
13,null,null,by which time I supposed he ought to have risen inflated with gases
14,null,null,the king sent out his men to look out for him
168 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Some other travellers from the north again informed us that they had heard of Wanguana who attempted to trade in Gani and Chopi
2,null,null,but were killed by the natives
3,null,null,I now assured Rumanika that in two or three years he would have a greater trade with Egypt than he ever could have with Zanzibar
4,null,null,for when I opened the road
5,null,null,all those men he heard of would swarm up here to visit him
6,null,null,however
7,sadness,laughed,only laughed at my folly in proposing to go to a place of which all I heard was merely that every stranger who went there was killed
169 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,He began to show a disinclination to allow my going there
2,null,null,and though from the most friendly intention
3,null,null,this view was alarming
4,null,null,for one word from him could have ruined my projects
5,null,null,As it was
6,fear,feared,I feared my followers might take fright and refuse to advance with me
7,null,null,I thought it good policy to talk of there being many roads leading through Africa
8,null,null,so that Rumanika might see he had not got
9,null,null,as he thought
10,null,null,the sole key to the interior .
170 15
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Although
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,this very interesting people
4,null,null,the Wahuma
5,happiness,delight,delight in supposing themselves to be of European origin
6,null,null,they are forced to confess
7,null,null,on closer examination
8,null,null,that although they came in the first instance from the doubtful north
9,null,null,they came latterly from the east
10,null,null,as part of a powerful Wahuma tribe
11,null,null,beyond Kidi
12,null,null,who excel in arms
13,null,null,and are so fierce no Kidi people
14,null,null,terrible in war as these too are described to be
15,null,null,can stand against them .
171 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,after ordering all the seizures to be given up to Maula on behalf of the king
2,null,null,and threatening to discharge any of my men who dared retain one item of the property
3,null,null,I shut the door of my hut to do penance for two days
4,null,null,giving orders that nobody but my cook Ilmas
5,null,null,not even Bombay
6,null,null,should come near me
7,null,null,for the king had caused my men to sin had disgraced their red cloth and had inflicted on me a greater insult than I could bear
8,sadness,ashamed,I was ashamed to show my face
9,null,null,Just as the door was closed
10,null,null,other pages from the king brought the Whitworth rifle to be cleaned
11,null,null,and demanded an admittance
172 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,On Maula 's return
2,happiness,generous,I was told the king would not believe so generous a man as Bana could have sent him so few beads
3,null,null,he believed most of my store must have been stolen on the road
4,null,null,and would ask me about that to-morrow .
173 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,He intimated that for the future I must fire a gun at the waiting hut whenever I entered the palace
2,null,null,so that he might hear of my arrival
3,null,null,for he had been up that morning
4,null,null,and would have been glad to see me
5,null,null,only the boys
6,fear,fear,from fear of entering his cabinet
7,null,null,had forged a lie
8,null,null,and deprived him of any interview with me
9,null,null,which he had long wished to get .
174 12
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,In a little while I felt tired of the monotony
2,null,null,and wished to hang up a curtain
3,null,null,that I might lie down in privacy and sleep till the king was ready
4,null,null,but the officers in waiting forbade this
5,null,null,as contrary to law
6,null,null,and left me the only alternative of walking up and down the court to kill time
7,null,null,spreading my umbrella against the powerful rays of the sun
8,null,null,A very little of that made me fidgety and impetuous
9,null,null,which the Waganda noticed
10,null,null,and
11,sadness,fear,from fear of the consequences
12,null,null,they began to close the gate to prevent my walking away .
175 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Until now I did not feel sure where the various rush drains I had been crossing since leaving the Katonga valley all went to
2,null,null,but here my mind was made up
3,null,null,for I found a large volume of water going to the northwards
4,null,null,I took off my clothes at the end of the bridge and jumped into the stream
5,null,null,which I found was twelve yards or so broad
6,null,null,and deeper than my height
7,happiness,delighted,I was delighted beyond measure at this very surprising fact
8,null,null,that I was indeed on the northern slopes of the continent
9,null,null,and had
10,null,null,to all appearance
11,null,null,found one of the branches of the Nile 's exit from the N'yanza .
176 11
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,at Anguza
3,null,null,"  Then you had two mothers and two fathers one set died at Anguja
4,null,null,and the other set at Anguza
5,null,null,you are a humbug
6,disgust,dont believe,I dont believe you
7,null,null,you are no Mguana
8,null,null,but a slave who has been snatched from his family
9,null,null,and does not know where any of his family are
10,null,null,ah
11,null,null,ah
177 17
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The first court passed
2,surprise,surprised,I was even more surprised to find the unusual ceremonies that awaited me
3,null,null,There courtiers of high dignity stepped forward to greet me
4,null,null,dressed in the most scrupulously neat fashions
5,null,null,Men
6,null,null,women
7,null,null,bulls
8,null,null,dogs
9,null,null,and goats
10,null,null,were led about by strings
11,null,null,cocks and hens were carried in men 's arms
12,null,null,and little pages
13,null,null,with rope turbans
14,null,null,rushed about
15,null,null,conveying messages
16,null,null,as if their lives depended on their swiftness
17,null,null,every one holding his skin cloak tightly round him lest his naked legs might by accident be shown .
178 12
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,but Ntalo wont be done
2,null,null,so retorts by saying
3,null,null,"  Sangizo
4,disgust,laugh,you may laugh at me because I am an orphan
5,null,null,but what are you
6,null,null,you are a savage a Mshezi
7,null,null,you come from the Mashenzi
8,null,null,and you wear skins
9,null,null,not cloths
10,null,null,as men do
11,null,null,so hold your impudent tongue "
12,null,null,and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again .
179 13
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,laugh,And all the men of the camp laugh together at the wretched Ntalo 's defeat
2,null,null,but Ntalo wont be done
3,null,null,so retorts by saying
4,null,null,"  Sangizo
5,null,null,you may laugh at me because I am an orphan
6,null,null,but what are you
7,null,null,you are a savage a Mshezi
8,null,null,you come from the Mashenzi
9,null,null,and you wear skins
10,null,null,not cloths
11,null,null,as men do
12,null,null,so hold your impudent tongue "
13,null,null,and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again .
180 22
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,The king acknowledged the truthfulness of their story
2,null,null,saying he had heard the same himself
3,null,null,and both Wakungu
4,null,null,as is the custom in Uganda
5,happiness,enthusiastic,thanked their lord in a very enthusiastic manner
6,null,null,kneeling on the ground for no one can stand in the presence of his majesty in an attitude of prayer
7,null,null,and throwing out their hands as they repeated the words N'yanzig
8,null,null,N'yanzig
9,null,null,ai N'yanzig Mkahma wangi
10,null,null,etc
11,null,null,etc
12,null,null,for a considerable time
13,null,null,when
14,null,null,thinking they had done enough of this
15,null,null,and heated with the exertion
16,null,null,they threw themselves flat upon their stomachs
17,null,null,and
18,null,null,floundering about like fish on land
19,null,null,repeated the same words over again and again
20,null,null,and rose doing the same
21,null,null,with their faces covered with earth
22,null,null,for majesty in Uganda is never satisfied till subjects have groveled before it like the most abject worms .
181 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,She admitted me at once
2,null,null,when I gave her quinine
3,null,null,on the proviso that I should stop there all day and night to repeat the dose
4,null,null,and tell her the reason why I did not come before
5,anger,anger,She affected great anger at Mtesa having interfered with my servants when coming to see her sympathised with me on the distance I had to travel ordered a hut to be cleared for me ere night told me to eat my breakfast in the next court and
6,null,null,rising abruptly
7,null,null,walked away
8,null,null,At noon we heard the king approaching with his drums and rattle traps
9,null,null,but I still waited on till 5 p
10,null,null,when
11,null,null,on summons
12,null,null,I repaired to the throne hut .
182 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,22d
2,null,null,To-day the king went the round of his relations
3,null,null,showing the beautiful things given him by the white man a clear proof that he was much favoured by the  "  spirits
4,null,null,"   for neither his father nor any of his forefathers had been so recognised and distinguished by any  "  sign "   as a rightful inheritor to the Uganda throne :  an anti-Christian interpretation of omens
5,null,null,as rife in these dark regions now as it was in the time of King Nebuchadnezzar
6,null,null,At midnight the three muskets were returned
7,happiness,pleased,and I was so pleased with the young king 's prompt attitude and honesty
8,null,null,I begged he would accept them .
183 13
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Here I heard
2,null,null,in an adjoining court
3,null,null,the boisterous
4,null,null,explosive laughs of both mother and son royal shouts loud enough to be heard a mile off
5,happiness,pleased,and inform the community that their sovereigns were pleased to indulge in hilarity
6,null,null,Immediately afterwards
7,null,null,the gate between us being thrown open
8,null,null,the king
9,null,null,like a very child
10,null,null,stood before us
11,null,null,dressed for the first time
12,null,null,in public
13,null,null,in what Europeans would call clothes .
184 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,And when the whole story was fully narrated
2,null,null,the matter was thought a good joke
3,null,null,After pausing a little
4,null,null,I asked the king what ailed him
5,sadness,sorry,for I was sorry to hear he had been sick
6,null,null,but instead of replying
7,null,null,he shook his head
8,null,null,as much as to say
9,null,null,I had put a very uncouth question to his majesty and ordered some men to shoot cows .
185 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Early in the morning
2,null,null,as I expected
3,null,null,she demanded my immediate attendance
4,null,null,and so the little diplomatic affair I had anticipated came on
5,null,null,I began the affair by intimating that I am in bed
6,null,null,and have not breakfasted
7,null,null,So at 10 a
8,null,null,another messenger arrives
9,surprise,surprised,to say her majesty is much surprised at my not coming
10,null,null,What can such conduct mean
11,null,null,when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire
12,null,null,that she might drink her medicine properly
186 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Instead of admiring this childish pastime
2,null,null,which in Uganda is considered royal sport
3,null,null,I rather looked disdainful
4,null,null,until
5,sadness,disappointed,apparently disappointed at my indifference
6,null,null,he asked what the box I had brought contained
7,null,null,On being told it was the medicine he desired
8,null,null,he asked me to draw near
9,null,null,and sent his courtiers away
10,null,null,When only the interpreters and one confidential officer were left
11,null,null,besides myself
12,null,null,he wished to know if I could apply the medicine without its touching the afflicted part .
187 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,What can such conduct mean
2,null,null,when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire
3,null,null,that she might drink her medicine properly
4,null,null,Still I am not up
5,fear,fear,but nobody will let me rest for fear of the queen
6,null,null,so
7,null,null,to while away the time
8,null,null,I order Bombay to call upon her
9,null,null,give the quinine
10,null,null,and tell her all that has happened
188 17
 (6, 6),(17, 6),
1,null,null,We reached the Cowes by torchlight at 9 p
2,null,null,when the king had a picnic dinner with me
3,null,null,turned in with his women in great comfort
4,null,null,and sent me off to a dreary hut
5,null,null,where I had to sleep upon a grass strew floor
6,surprise,surprised,I was surprised we had to walk so far
7,null,null,when
8,null,null,by appearance
9,null,null,we might have boated it from the head of the creek all the way down
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,on inquiry
12,null,null,was informed of the swampy nature of the ground at the head of the creek precluded any approach to the clear water there
13,null,null,and hence the long overland journey
14,null,null,which
15,null,null,though fatiguing to the unfortunate women
16,null,null,who had to trot the whole way behind Mtesa 's four mile an hour strides
17,surprise,amusing,was very amusing .
189 9
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,He stared
2,null,null,and everybody stared
3,null,null,believing me to be a magician
4,null,null,when the king said he would like to have pictures of the birds drawn and hung up in the palace
5,null,null,"  but let us go and shoot some more
6,happiness,wonderful,for it is truly wonderful
7,null,null,Similar results followed
8,null,null,for the herons were continually whirling round
9,null,null,as they had their nests upon a neighbouring tree
190 8
 (5, 5),(7, 5),
1,null,null,I now asked permission to speak with him on some important matters
2,null,null,when he sent his women away and listened
3,null,null,I said I felt anxious about the road on which Mabruki was travelling
4,null,null,to which I added that I had ordered him to tell Petherick to come here or else to send property to the value of one thousand dollars
5,fear,anxious,and I felt anxious because some of the queen 's officers felt doubtful about Waganda being able to penetrate Kidi
6,null,null,He said I need not concern myself on that score
7,fear,anxious,he was much more anxious for the white men to come here than even I was
8,null,null,and he would not send my men into any danger
191 17
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,He then thought of adjutant shooting with ball
2,null,null,left the court sitting
3,null,null,desired me to follow him
4,null,null,and leading the way
5,null,null,went into the interior of the palace
6,null,null,where only a few select officers were permitted to follow us
7,null,null,The birds were wild
8,null,null,and as nothing was done
9,null,null,I instructed him in the way to fire from his shoulder
10,null,null,placing the gun in position
11,null,null,He was shy at first
12,sadness,laughed,and all the people laughed at my handling royalty like a schoolboy
13,null,null,but he soon took to it very good naturedly
14,null,null,when I gave him my silk necktie and gold crest ring
15,null,null,explaining their value
16,null,null,which he could not comprehend
17,null,null,and telling him we gentlemen prided ourselves on never wearing brass or copper .
192 9
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,There was something in her manner when she said this that I did not like it looked suspicious
2,null,null,and I contented myself by saying
3,null,null,"  No
4,null,null,I am a wiser doctor than any in these lands
5,null,null,if anybody could cure you
6,null,null,that person is myself :  and further
7,null,null,if I gave you a goat to sacrifice
8,anger,angry,God would be angry with both of us for our superstitious credulity
9,null,null,you must therefore say no more about it .  "
193 8
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,So the four sang
2,null,null,each in turn
3,null,null,and died in the sight of some who pitied
4,fear,feared,and some who feared
5,null,null,and some who hated
6,null,null,for the sake of land and women
7,null,null,So the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw
8,null,null,and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river .
194 8
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,So the four sang

195 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There was no time to think
2,fear,fear,my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann
3,null,null,Just then I heard her calling out to me .
196 4
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light
2,null,null,now through one loophole and now through another
3,null,null,until a ray slanted from the western wall and rested upon the red-and-black paint of two dead bodies in the corner
4,fear,stared with horror,I stared with horror .
197 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Ye ought to hev seen the trash we turned back
2,null,null,Polly Ann
3,fear,scared,Most of ' em was scared plum crazy

5,null,null,Some was fer fighting ' their way through us
198 8
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,and ' what did ye say
2,null,null,'' demanded Polly Ann
3,null,null,pausing in her work
4,anger,her eyes flashing with resentment,her eyes flashing with resentment
5,null,null,Did ye tell ' em they was cowards to want to settle lands
6,null,null,and not fight for ' em
7,null,null,Other folks ' lands
8,null,null,too
199 14
 (6, 6),(13, 6),
1,null,null,The horse with the craning neck
2,null,null,the liveried servant at the bridle
3,null,null,the listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the horse block
4,null,null,and above him
5,null,null,under the portico
6,sadness,made me sad,the grand lady whose laugh had  made me sad
7,null,null,And I remembered
8,null,null,too
9,null,null,the wild
10,null,null,neglected lad who had been to me as a brother
11,null,null,warm-hearted and generous
12,null,null,who had shared what he had with a foundling
13,sadness,wept with me in my first great sorrow,who had wept with me in my first great sorrow
14,null,null,Where was he
200 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,I fear that your kind efforts will be useless
2,null,null,Colonel
3,null,null,'' Major Colfax put in
4,null,null,rather tartly
5,null,null,Mr
6,null,null,McChesney not only ignores my rights
7,null,null,but was near to hanging my agent
201 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I flushed again
2,null,null,and began by stammering
3,fear,fear,For I had a great fear that Major Colfax 's temper would fly into bits when he heard it .
202 10
 (10, 4),
1,null,null,No man east of the mountains knows the horror of that Indian warfare
2,null,null,This government gives them no protection now
3,null,null,Nay
4,null,null,Congress cannot even procure for them an outlet for their commerce
5,null,null,They must trade or perish
6,null,null,Spain closes the Mississippi
7,null,null,arrests our merchants
8,null,null,seizes their goods
9,null,null,and often throws them into prison
10,disgust,scorn,No wonder they scorn the Congress as weak and impotent
203 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion
2,null,null,Then he turned and walked away very slowly
3,disgust,shame,as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat
4,null,null,The young man flung away the fence rail
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers
7,null,null,he strode past me into the tavern
8,null,null,his anger still hot .
204 5
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,I fear that we are losing our heads
2,null,null,gentlemen
3,null,null,'' he said
4,null,null,and I propose to you the health of the first citizen of Kentucky
5,null,null,Colonel George Rogers Clark .
205 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,A fear that you were married
2,null,null,'' he said
3,null,null,with a boldness that made me blush
4,null,null,As for Mademoiselle
5,null,null,a color that vied with the June roses charged through her cheeks
6,null,null,She stooped to pick up her sewing
7,null,null,but Nick was before her .
206 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,No
2,null,null,'' I answered shortly
3,null,null,Then I realized suddenly what I had failed to grasp before
4,fear,feared,she feared that I would pity her .
207 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,For a while the tune held its mad pace
2,null,null,and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note
3,null,null,for Zeron had broken a string
4,null,null,Amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room I saw Nick stop before an open window in which a prying Indian was framed
5,null,null,swing Suzanne at arm 's length
6,fear,startled him into life,and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life .
208 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,We lighted a candle
2,null,null,and poking around
3,null,null,found the negro where he had crept into the farthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall
4,fear,blood curdling,And when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was blood curdling .
209 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The young lady did nothing of the kind
2,null,null,She turned her back to us
3,null,null,leaned against the tree
4,surprise,to my astonishment,and to my astonishment I saw her slim shoulders shaken with laughter
5,null,null,At length
6,null,null,very slowly
7,null,null,she looked around
8,null,null,and in her face struggled curiosity and fear and merriment .
210 6
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,She is my mother
2,null,null,'' said Nick
3,null,null,with a bitterness I had not thought in him
4,null,null,she is my mother
5,anger,curse,or I would curse her
6,null,null,For she has ruined my life and brought shame on a good name
211 7
 (5, 1),
1,null,null,Presently the sobs ceased
2,null,null,and Mrs
3,null,null,Temple raised her face
4,null,null,slowly
5,surprise,wondering ly,wondering ly
6,null,null,as if she had not heard aright
7,null,null,And she tried gently to push the girl away .

4,null,null,they are only possible for the bachelor
5,null,null,Hearing a noise
6,fear,nervously,he glanced nervously in the direction of the woods
7,null,null,only to perceive his negro carrying a pail of water
8,null,null,I I was expecting some friends
9,null,null,'' he said
10,null,null,Sit down
11,null,null,Davy
213 14
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,And wasnt it me that said he could smell the devils
2,null,null,'' said Terence
3,null,null,as he circled around us in a mimic war dance
4,surprise,in astonishment,And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment
5,null,null,and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing
6,null,null,For the back woodsmen were children of nature
7,null,null,Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain
8,null,null,and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played   Billy of the Wild Woods and   Jump Juba
9,null,null,'' with all his might
10,null,null,and the pine knots threw their fitful
11,null,null,red light on the wild scenes of merriment
12,null,null,I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance
13,null,null,for presently Colonel Clark came up to us
14,null,null,laughing in his quiet way .
214 14
 (5, 5),

13,null,null,for presently Colonel Clark came up to us
14,null,null,laughing in his quiet way .
215 15
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Then came the sugaring
2,null,null,the warm days and the freezing nights when the earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red sunset
3,null,null,Old and young went to the camps
4,null,null,the women and children boiling and graining
5,null,null,the squads of men posted in guards round about
6,null,null,And after that the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst suddenly into white flower
7,null,null,and it was spring again
8,happiness,joy,And then a joy to be long remembered  I went on a hunting trip with Tom and Cowan and three others where the Kentucky tumbles between its darkly wooded cliffs
9,null,null,And other wonders of that strange land I saw then for the first time :  great licks
10,null,null,trampled down for acres by the wild herds
11,null,null,where the salt water oozes out of the hoofprints
12,null,null,On the edge of one of these licks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here and there in the black mud
13,null,null,and great skulls of fearful beasts half embedded
14,null,null,This was called the Big Bone Lick
15,null,null,and some travellers that went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these monsters of a past age .
216 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Then I heard a voice calling me
2,null,null,and pushing past Mrs
3,null,null,Cowan
4,null,null,I ran into the cabin
5,null,null,Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead
6,surprise,not imagined,and she turned to mine a face radiant with a happiness I had not imagined
217 15
 (13, 13),
1,null,null,The Indians had shot at a party shelling corn at Captain Bowman 's plantation
2,null,null,and killed two
3,null,null,while the others had taken refuge in the crib
4,null,null,Fired at from every brake
5,null,null,James Ray had ridden to Harrodstown for succor
6,null,null,and the savages had been beaten off
7,null,null,But only the foolhardy returned to their clearings now
8,null,null,We were on the edge of another dreaded summer of siege
9,null,null,the prospect of banishment from the homes we could almost see
10,null,null,staring us in the face
11,null,null,and the labors of the spring lost again
12,null,null,There was bitter talk within the gates that night
13,anger,angrily,and many declared angrily that Colonel Clark had abandoned us
14,null,null,But I remembered what he had said
15,null,null,and had faith in him .
218 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,They turned
2,happiness,an ecstasy of joy,and in an ecstasy of joy quite pitiful to see went trooping out of the gate
3,null,null,But scarce could they have reached the street and we have broken ranks
4,null,null,when we saw them coming back again
5,null,null,the priest leading them as before
6,null,null,They drew near to the spot where Clark stood
7,null,null,talking to the captains
8,null,null,and halted expectantly .
219 3
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,The group stood wistful
2,fear,fearful,fearful that their boldness had displeased
3,null,null,expectant of reprimand .
220 6
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,At length the cocks crowing for day proclaimed the morning
2,null,null,and while yet the blue shadow of the bluff was on the town
3,null,null,Colonel Clark sallied out of the gate and walked abroad
4,surprise,Strange,Strange it seemed that war had come to this village
5,null,null,so peaceful and remote
6,null,null,And even stranger it seemed to me to see these Arcadian homes in the midst of the fierce wilderness .
221 17
 (10, 11),(10, 12),
1,null,null,Excitement keyed us high
2,null,null,we reached the shade
3,null,null,plunged into it
4,null,null,and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing
5,null,null,It had once defended the place
6,null,null,but now stood abandoned and dismantled
7,null,null,Beyond it
8,null,null,at the edge of the bluff
9,null,null,we halted
10,surprise,astonished,astonished
11,null,null,The sun was falling in the west
12,null,null,and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much
13,null,null,At our feet
14,null,null,across the wooded bottom
15,null,null,was the Kaskaskia River
16,null,null,and beyond
17,null,null,the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light .
222 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,To see the strange places of the world
2,null,null,and the stranger people
3,null,null,to become a man of wealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo
4,fear,fear,and ( I fear I loved it best ) to match my brains with others at a bargain
5,null,null,I turned it all over slowly
6,null,null,gravely
7,null,null,in my boyish mind
8,null,null,rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin .
223 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),

5,null,null,greasy mixture
6,null,null,And the Colonel

8,null,null,turned his face away down stream .

1,null,null,There was no time to think
2,fear,fear,my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann
3,null,null,Just then I heard her calling out to me .
231 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I flushed again
2,null,null,and began by stammering

1,null,null,Then the moment of departure came
2,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite acknowledged the parting remarks of the servants
3,happiness,secretly delighted,who were secretly delighted to be freed from her presence
4,null,null,and then
5,null,null,before entering the carriage
6,null,null,she cast a long
7,null,null,sad look upon this princely mansion which she had once had the right to believe her own
8,null,null,but which she was
9,null,null,alas
10,null,null,now leaving

1,null,null,The worthy housekeeper was present at this conference
2,fear,feared,For an instant she had feared that Mademoiselle Marguerite suspected her manoeuvres but her fears were now dispelled
3,null,null,and she even congratulated herself on her skilful ness .
237 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This furnished Madame de Fondege with another excuse for proffering her advice
2,null,null,But Mademoiselle Marguerite would not allow herself to be convinced at once
3,null,null,She raised a great many objections
4,happiness,happy,and parleyed for a long time before telling Madame de Fondege that she would be happy to accept the hospitality which had been offered her
5,null,null,And her consent was by no means unconditional .
238 10
 (3, 9),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's address must be there
2,null,null,so she asked and obtained permission to examine this notebook
3,happiness,to her great joy,and to her great joy
4,null,null,under the letter  "  F
5,null,null,"   she found the entry :   "  Fortunat ( Isidore )

2,null,null,"   and knowing that his work in the house had not been concluded
3,surprise,extremely surprised,she was extremely surprised that he had not yet put in an appearance .
240 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,feared,It was easy to see by Madame de Fondege 's earnestness that she feared Mademoiselle Marguerite would avail herself of this opportunity of recovering her liberty
2,null,null,"  What shall I do
3,null,null,then
4,null,null,"   asked the girl .

 (1, 2),

2,null,null,They are waiting for me downstairs
3,disgust,impatient,and they are no doubt becoming impatient
4,null,null,It is the first time in my life that I was ever behind time .  "
244 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,But how she revenged herself
2,null,null,She was  "  virtuous
3,null,null,"   but so dangerously virtuous that one might have supposed she was so against her will
4,sadness,bitterly  regretted,and that she bitterly  regretted it
5,null,null,She ruled her husband with a rod of iron .
245 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I searched under all the trees
2,null,null,and yet I could not find her
3,null,null,It was as dark as pitch
4,fear,a terrible fear,and suddenly a terrible fear seized hold of me such a terrible fright that I really believe I called for help
5,null,null,and I ran back to the house half crazed .  "
246 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But the worthy woman had already recovered her self possession and her accustomed loquacity at the same time
2,null,null,"  Ah

5,null,null,bravely
6,sadness,in such sorrow,"  im in such sorrow that im losing my senses completely
7,null,null,Still
8,null,null,it was only from the kindest of motives that I ventured into the garden
9,null,null,and I had scarcely entered it before I saw something white run away from me I felt sure it was Mirza and so I ran after it .

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday
2,null,null,Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country
3,fear,feared,and Chupin feared he might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements
4,null,null,And while running to the Place de la Bourse
5,null,null,he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate
6,null,null,deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says :   "  It is not always well to tell the whole truth .  "
248 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Still it did not prevent him from trying to justify himself
2,null,null,although he was careful not to confess the truth
3,fear,dreaded,for he dreaded his mother 's censure
4,null,null,knowing well enough that she would be less indulgent than his own conscience .
249 16
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,However
2,null,null,the effect of this discovery was to dispel his anger
3,null,null,or rather to restore his calmness
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,addressing M
6,null,null,de Coralth
7,null,null,he exclaimed :   "  dont be angry at what i 've said
8,null,null,m ' sieur
9,null,null,it was only a jest I know that there 's a wide difference between a poor devil like me and a viscount like you I have n't a sou

2,surprise,surprised,I should n't at all be surprised if I found that he wanted to cook his bread in our oven
3,null,null,But father Fortunat would n't be pleased with the news .
251 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,He had made a hundred turns perhaps
2,null,null,passing the events of the day in review
3,null,null,when suddenly such a strange and startling idea flashed across his mind that he stood motionless
4,surprise,lost in astonishment,lost in astonishment
5,null,null,Reflecting on the manner in which M
6,null,null,Wilkie and the Viscount de Coralth had behaved during the evening
7,null,null,a singular suspicion assailed him .
252 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,But he racked his brain in vain in trying to remember who this newcomer was
2,null,null,in trying to set a name on this face
3,null,null,which was positively annoying in its classical beauty
4,null,null,and which he felt convinced had occupied a place among the phantoms of his past
5,anger,Irritated beyond endurance,Irritated beyond endurance by what he termed his stupidity
6,null,null,he was trying to decide whether he should enter the cafe or not
7,null,null,when he saw M
8,null,null,Wilkie take his bill from the hands of a waiter
9,null,null,glance at it
10,null,null,and throw a louis on the table .

2,null,null,you little wretch
3,anger,so indignant,"   He was so indignant that the gamin element in his nature stirred again under his fine broadcloth
4,null,null,and he had a wild longing to throw stones at M
5,null,null,Wilkie .
254 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,He was carrying a letter which he wished to have delivered
2,fear,feared,and no doubt he feared he would not be able to find a commissionaire
3,null,null,Having discovered one at last
4,null,null,he called him
5,null,null,gave him the missive
6,null,null,and then pursued his way more leisurely .

1,null,null,Having come with the intention of offering his agent a handsome sum
2,surprise,surprised,he was agreeably surprised to find that Chupin 's scruples would enable him to save his money

6,null,null,"  I should have thought you had been drinking .
256 6

2,null,null,no one came
3,null,null,still they recalled Pascal to a sense of the situation
4,sadness,ashamed,and he was ashamed of his violence
5,null,null,He released Madame Leon
6,null,null,and his manner suddenly became as humble as it had been threatening .
259 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The frightened housekeeper struggled with all her might
2,null,null,trying her best to reach the little gate which was standing open

9,null,null,Duncan Street
10,null,null,Hounds ditch
11,null,null,she cried
12,null,null,This begins to look genuine
13,null,null,I thought
14,null,null,and having seen her safely inside
15,null,null,I perched myself behind .
362 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,When I reached him
2,null,null,he was groping about frantically in the empty cab
3,null,null,and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to
4,null,null,There was no sign or trace of his passenger
5,fear,fear,and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare
6,null,null,On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paper hanger
7,null,null,named Keswick
8,null,null,and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there .
363 10
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,How he came there
2,null,null,or how he met his fate
3,null,null,are questions which are still involved in mystery
4,null,null,Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson
5,null,null,We are glad to learn that Mr
6,null,null,Lestrade and Mr
7,null,null,Gregson
8,null,null,of Scotland Yard
9,null,null,are both engaged upon the case
10,happiness,confidently,and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter .

1,null,null,The fun of it is
2,sadness,he cried,he cried
3,null,null,that that fool Lestrade
4,null,null,who thinks himself so smart
5,null,null,has gone off upon the wrong track altogether
6,null,null,He is after the secretary Stangerson
7,null,null,who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn
8,null,null,I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time .

7,null,null,sir
8,fear,fear,Do not imagine that my agitation on be half of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair
9,null,null,He is utterly innocent of it
10,null,null,My dread is
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised
13,null,null,That
14,null,null,however
15,null,null,is surely impossible
16,null,null,His high character
17,null,null,his profession
18,null,null,his antecedents would all forbid it .

1,happiness,My heart grew light,My heart grew light when I saw him drive away
2,null,null,My son is on leave just now
3,null,null,but I did not tell him anything of all this
4,null,null,for his temper is violent
5,null,null,and he is passionately fond of his sister .
367 10
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind
2,null,null,Alas
3,null,null,in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell
4,null,null,and I learned that Mr
5,null,null,Drebber had returned
6,happiness,excited,He was much excited
7,null,null,and evidently the worse for drink
8,null,null,He forced his way into the room
9,null,null,where I was sitting with my daughter

1,null,null,You shall live like a princess
2,fear,so frightened,Poor Alice was so frightened  that she shrunk away from him
3,null,null,but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door
4,null,null,I screamed
5,null,null,and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room .

1,null,null,He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes

372 12
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,I have now in my hands
2,null,null,my companion said

4,null,null,all the threads which have formed such a tangle
5,null,null,There are
6,null,null,of course
7,null,null,details tobe filled in

9,null,null,from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station
10,null,null,up to the discovery of the body of the latter
11,null,null,as if I had seen them with my own eyes

376 7
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,could hardly believe,This last statement appeared to me to be so startling that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses
2,null,null,There was the dead dog
3,null,null,however
4,null,null,to prove that his conjecture had been correct
5,null,null,It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away
6,null,null,and I began to have a dim
7,null,null,vague perception of the truth .
377 5
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,surprise,surprised,I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey
2,null,null,since he had not said anything to me about it

3,fear,doubly terrible,made this organization doubly terrible
4,null,null,It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent
5,null,null,and yet was neither seen nor heard .
381 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,He was still sitting with his elbow upon his knee
2,null,null,considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter
3,null,null,when a soft hand was laid upon his
4,null,null,and looking up
5,null,null,he saw her standing beside him
6,null,null,One glance at her pale
7,fear,frightened,frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed .

3,null,null,Still more surprised was he on the entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting room
4,null,null,One
5,null,null,with a long pale face
6,null,null,was leaning back in the rocking chair
7,null,null,with his feet cocked up upon the stove
8,null,null,The other

385 6
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,puzzled,How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely
2,null,null,for his servants slept in an outhouse
3,null,null,and the doors and windows had all been secured
4,null,null,He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter
5,null,null,but the incident struck a chill into his heart
6,null,null,The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised .
386 9
 (3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,Still more shaken was he next morning
2,null,null,They had sat down to their breakfast

4,null,null,In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled
5,null,null,with a burned stick apparently
6,null,null,the number 28
7,null,null,To his daughter it was unintelligible
8,null,null,and he did not enlighten her
9,null,null,That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward .
387 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success
2,null,null,though
3,null,null,from the marks upon the bark of the trees
4,null,null,and other indications
5,null,null,he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity
6,null,null,At last
7,null,null,after two or three hours   fruitless search
8,sadness,despair,he was thinking of turning back in despair
9,null,null,when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart
10,null,null,On the edge of a jutting pinnacle
11,null,null,three or four hundred feet above him
12,null,null,there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance
13,null,null,but armed with a pair of gigantic horns .
388 8
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left  them
2,null,null,Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it
3,null,null,They must
4,null,null,he reflected
5,fear,anxiously,be awaiting him anxiously
6,null,null,for he had been absent nearly five hours
7,null,null,In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming
8,null,null,He paused and listened for an answer .
389 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Their faces were pale and sad
2,null,null,and there were tears in the eyes of some of them
3,null,null,What was passing in their minds
4,fear,fear,Perhaps they were overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected death always provokes
5,null,null,Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master
6,null,null,whose bread they ate
7,null,null,Perhaps their grief was only selfishness
8,null,null,and they were merely wondering what would become of them
9,null,null,where they should find another situation
10,null,null,and if it would prove a good one .
390 11
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,No one ventured to reply
2,surprise,surprise,and in her surprise she cast a hasty glance around
3,null,null,From where she stood
4,null,null,she could not see the bed stationed in an alcove
5,null,null,but she instantly noted the dejected attitude of the servants
6,null,null,the clothing scattered about the floor
7,null,null,and the disorder that pervaded this magnificent but severely furnished chamber
8,null,null,which was only lighted by the lamp which M
9,null,null,Bourigeau
10,null,null,the concierge
11,null,null,carried .
391 9
 (1, 6),(9, 6),

2,null,null,the servants held their breath
3,null,null,wondering how it would all end
4,null,null,It ended suddenly

3,null,null,through Madame Leon
4,null,null,requesting me to join him in the garden
5,null,null,I hastened there
6,surprise,surprised,very much surprised
7,null,null,for the weather was extremely disagreeable
8,null,null,' dear Marguerite
9,null,null,' he said
10,null,null,on seeing me
11,null,null,' help me to find the fragments of that letter which I flung from the window this morning .
394 5
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  I was much grieved at the count 's disappointment
2,null,null,"   continued Mademoiselle Marguerite
3,null,null,"  but suddenly he exclaimed
4,happiness,joyfully :,joyfully :  ' that address why

 (7, 6),
1,null,null,At five he rose
2,null,null,kissed me gay ly
3,null,null,and left the house on foot
4,null,null,telling me that he was confident of success
5,null,null,and that he did not expect to return before midnight
6,null,null,The poor child 's firmness now gave way
7,sadness,eyes filled with tears,her eyes filled with tears
8,null,null,and it was in a voice choked with sobs that she added

397 3
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,pleasing,Such a proposal was anything but pleasing to M
2,null,null,Jodon
3,null,null,who had met with the same misfortune in this aristocratic neighborhood several times before .
398 7
 (6, 4),(6, 5),
1,null,null,When an accident happened
2,null,null,he was summoned because he chanced to be close at hand
3,null,null,but just as he was flattering himself that he had gained a desirable patient
4,null,null,he found himself in presence of some celebrated physician
5,null,null,who had come from a distance in his carriage
6,sadness,disappointments,Accustomed to such disappointments
7,null,null,he knew how to conceal his dissatisfaction .
399 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,As a rule
2,null,null,Chupin was not easily impressed
3,fear,frightened,but he felt almost frightened by his employer 's agitation
4,null,null,"  I only repeated what M

 (5, 4),
1,null,null,"  I can certainly discover the necessary pretext here
2,null,null,"   he murmured
3,null,null,rummaging through the mass of papers
4,null,null,But he did not at once find what he sought
5,disgust,impatient,and he was growing impatient
6,null,null,as could be seen by his feverish haste
7,null,null,when all at once he paused with a sigh of relief
8,null,null,"  At last

 (7, 4),(7, 6),
1,null,null,The woman looked at him
2,null,null,Most job masters are in the habit of giving five sous to any servant who comes in search of a cab for his master
3,null,null,and this was the custom here
4,null,null,But the keeper of the office
5,null,null,who felt sure that Chupin was not a servant
6,null,null,hesitated

10,null,null,imperiously
11,null,null,"  If you dont
12,null,null,I shall run to the nearest stand .  "
402 9
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,But to carry out this arrangement it was necessary to have a sheet of stamped paper
2,null,null,and the spurious clerk had neglected to provide himself with some
3,disgust,annoy,This circumstance seemed to annoy him greatly
4,null,null,and you might almost have sworn that he regretted the concession he had promised
5,null,null,Did he think of going
6,null,null,Madame Vantrasson feared so
7,null,null,and turning eagerly to her husband
8,null,null,she exclaimed :    "  Run to the tobacco shop in the Rue de Levis
9,null,null,you will find some paper there

 (7, 10),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's countenance wore an expression of profound commiseration
2,null,null,A looker on would have supposed him interested and sympathetic to the last degree
3,null,null,but in reality
4,null,null,he was furious
5,null,null,Time was passing
6,null,null,and the conversation was wandering farther and farther from the object of his visit
7,surprise,surprised,"  I am surprised
8,null,null,madame
9,null,null,"   said he
10,null,null,"  that you never applied to your former employer
11,null,null,the Count de Chalusse .  "
404 10
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Isidore Fortunat was literally upon the rack
2,null,null,and to make his sufferings still more horrible
3,null,null,he dared not ask any direct question
4,null,null,nor allow his curiosity to become manifest
5,fear,fear,for fear of alarming the woman
6,null,null,"  Let me see
7,null,null,"   said he
8,null,null,"  I think I am sure that I have heard or that I have read I cannot say which some story about a Mademoiselle de Chalusse

 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,It was Madame Vantrasson 's turn to tremble now
2,fear,feared,She feared
3,null,null,if she allowed this supposed clerk to go without signing the agreement
4,null,null,that the person who came in his stead might not prove so accommodating
5,null,null,and even if he called again himself
6,null,null,he might not be so kindly disposed
7,null,null,"  Wait just a moment longer
8,null,null,monsieur
9,null,null,"   she pleaded
10,null,null,"  my husband will soon be back
11,null,null,and the last omnibus does n't leave the Rue de Levis until midnight .  "
406 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,At this point in her narrative Madame Vantrasson evinced a desire to pause and draw a breath
2,null,null,and perhaps partake of some slight refreshment
3,null,null,but M

5,null,null,The woman 's husband might return at any moment
6,null,null,"  And
7,null,null,after that
8,null,null,"   he inquired .
407 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It was the old
2,null,null,sad story of a ruined girl paying for a moment 's madness with her happiness and all her after life
3,null,null,A terrible drama
4,null,null,no doubt
5,null,null,but one that is of such frequent occurrence that it seems as commonplace as life itself
6,null,null,Thus any one who was acquainted with M

8,null,null,"  Poor girl
9,null,null,"   said he
10,null,null,in view of saying something
11,null,null,And then
12,null,null,in a tone of assumed carelessness
13,null,null,he inquired :    "  Did they never discover what scoundrel carried Mademoiselle de Chalusse away
408 16
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,You could not say that M
2,null,null,Fortunat was angry
3,null,null,Such a man
4,null,null,as cold and as smooth as a hundred franc piece
5,null,null,has no useless passions
6,null,null,But he was intensely irritated to hear his client foolishly chanting the paeons of victory
7,null,null,while he was compelled to conceal his grief at the loss of his forty thousand francs
8,null,null,deep in the recesses of his heart
9,null,null,So
10,null,null,far from being touched by the marquis 's evident alarm
11,happiness,pleased,it pleased him to be able to turn the dagger in the wound he had just inflicted
12,null,null,"  You must excuse my incredulity
13,null,null,"   said he
14,null,null,"  It comes entirely from something you

 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Fortunat 's embarrassment was really painful to witness
2,null,null,He was not usually wanting in courage
3,null,null,but the events of the evening had shaken his confidence and his composure
4,null,null,The hope of gain and the fear of loss had deprived him of his wanted clearness of mind
5,null,null,Feeling that he had just committed a terrible blunder
6,null,null,he racked his brain to find some way of repairing it
7,null,null,and finding none

9,null,null,Not at all
10,null,null,however
11,null,null,on the contrary
12,null,null,she had good cause to congratulate herself upon the notoriety she gained through this suicide
13,null,null,For five days she was the talk of Paris
14,null,null,and Alfred d' aunay even published her portrait in the Illustrated Chronicle .
414 13
 (9, 3),(9, 4),(9, 5),
1,null,null,The poor woman she was a widow sold all she possessed
2,null,null,even the bed on which she slept
3,null,null,and when she had succeeded in gathering together twenty thousand francs the ransom of her son 's honor she carried them to the banker by whom her boy had been employed

2,null,null,but this was visible only at the corners
3,null,null,for it was covered
4,null,null,in turn
5,null,null,with a green baize cloth considerably the worse for wear
6,null,null,Madame d' argeles 's guests were probably not over fifty in number
7,null,null,but they all seemed to belong to the very best society
8,null,null,The majority of them were men of forty or thereabouts
9,null,null,several wore decorations
10,null,null,and two or three of the eldest were treated with marked deference
11,surprise,surprised,Certain well-known names which Pascal overheard surprised him greatly
12,null,null,"  What
13,null,null,these men here
14,null,null,"   he said to himself
15,null,null,"  and I I regarded my visit as a sort of clandestine frolic .  "

 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A score of persons were seated at the card table
2,null,null,and the guests who had retired into the adjoining salon were silently watching the progress of the game
3,null,null,or quietly chatting in the corners of the room
4,surprise,surprised,It surprised him to note that every one spoke in very low tones
5,null,null,there was something very like respect
6,null,null,even awe
7,null,null,in this subdued murmur
8,null,null,One might have supposed that those present were celebrating the rites of some mysterious worship .
417 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The wisest counsels
2,null,null,given in a certain fashion
3,null,null,never fail to produce an effect diametrically opposed to that which they seemingly aim at

5,null,null,and the importance he attached to a mere trifle
6,null,null,could not fail to annoy the most patient man in the world
7,anger,irritated,and in fact his patronizing tone really irritated Pascal
8,null,null,"  You are free
9,null,null,my friend
10,null,null,to do as you please
11,null,null,"   said he
12,null,null,"  but I   "
418 13
 (7, 5),
1,null,null,However the game proceeded
2,null,null,but no one paid any attention to it
3,null,null,The stakes were insignificant
4,null,null,and loss or gain drew no exclamation from any one
5,null,null,The attention of the entire party was concentrated on Pascal
6,null,null,and he
7,sadness,with despair in his heart,with despair in his heart
8,null,null,followed the movements of the cards
9,null,null,which were passing from hand to hand
10,null,null,and fast approaching him again
11,null,null,When they reached him the silence became breathless
12,null,null,menacing
13,null,null,even sinister .
419 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He did not deign to turn his head
2,null,null,What did the insult matter to him
3,null,null,He knew himself to be innocent
4,sadness,disgraced,and yet he felt that he was sinking to the lowest depths of infamy he beheld himself disgraced
5,null,null,branded
6,null,null,ruined
7,null,null,And realizing that he must meet facts with facts
8,null,null,he besought God to grant him an idea
9,null,null,an inspiration
10,null,null,that would unmask the real culprit .
420 9
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,Such was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests
2,anger,angry,Four or five of the ladies took flight at the bare suggestion and several men the most aristocratic of the company became angry at once
3,null,null,"  Are you mad
4,null,null,"   said one of them
5,null,null,"  Do you want to see us all summoned as witnesses
6,null,null,You have probably forgotten that Garcia affair
7,null,null,and that rumpus at Jenny Fancy 's house
8,null,null,A fine thing it would be to see
9,null,null,no one knows how many great names mixed up with those of sharper s and notorious women
421 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Naturally of a florid complexion
2,null,null,the baron 's face now became scarlet
3,fear,fear,"  So it 's fear of scandal that deters you

6,null,null,a man 's courage should equal his vices
7,null,null,Look at me .  "
422 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,This superb outburst of outraged honor
2,null,null,this marvellous energy  succeeding
3,null,null,as it did
4,null,null,the most complete mental prostration and these terrible threats
5,null,null,had proved so prompt and awe-inspiring that no one had thought of cutting off Pascal 's retreat
6,null,null,The guests had not recovered from their stupor
7,fear,silent and intimidated,but were still standing silent and intimidated when they heard the outer door close after him .
423 17
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,It shuts its eyes and refuses to look or listen
2,null,null,But this is all the more reason why it should be pitiless when a person 's guilt is positively established
3,null,null,Thus
4,null,null,although he assumed an air of insolent security
5,fear,anxiously,the  "  viscount "   anxiously watched the effect of his words upon Madame d' argeles
6,null,null,Fortunately for himself
7,null,null,he saw that she was abashed by his cynicism
8,null,null,and so he resumed :   "  Besides
9,null,null,as our friend
10,null,null,the baron
11,null,null,would say
12,null,null,we are wasting precious time in discussing improbable
13,null,null,and even impossible
14,null,null,suppositions
15,null,null,I was sufficiently well acquainted with your heart and your intelligence
16,null,null,my dear madame
17,null,null,to be sure that you would not speak a word to my disparagement .  "
424 15
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,disgust,impatient,With the impatient gesture of a man who finds himself compelled to answer an idle question
2,null,null,and assuming an air of hypocritical commiseration
3,null,null,he replied :   "  Well
4,null,null,since you insist upon it
5,null,null,I know
6,null,null,in Paris in the Rue de Helder
7,null,null,to be more exact a nice young fellow
8,null,null,whose lot I have often envied
9,null,null,He has wanted for nothing since the day he came into the world
10,null,null,At school
11,null,null,he had three times as much money as his richest play fellow
12,null,null,When his studies were finished
13,null,null,a tutor was provided with his pockets full of gold to conduct this favored youth to Italy
14,null,null,Egypt
15,null,null,and Greece .

2,sadness,compassion,de Coralth would have had some compassion
3,null,null,for Madame d' argeles was evidently suffering agony
4,null,null,"  It is as I feared

12,null,null,There
13,null,null,my dear lady
14,null,null,your letter ended
15,null,null,but the name and address were given
16,null,null,and it was easy enough to understand it
17,null,null,You remember
18,null,null,perhaps
19,null,null,a little incident that occurred after your return .
428 10
 (5, 5),(5, 7),(5, 10),
1,null,null,She went to sleep one night possessing an income of fifteen thousand francs
2,null,null,but she awoke to find herself ruined so completely ruined that she did not know where to obtain her dinner for that same evening
3,null,null,Had she been alone in the world
4,null,null,she would not have grieved much over the catastrophe
5,sadness,sadly,but she was sadly affected by the thought that her son 's future was
6,null,null,perhaps
7,null,null,irrevocably blighted
8,null,null,and that
9,null,null,in any case
10,null,null,this disaster would condemn him to enter life through the cramped and gloomy portals of poverty .
429 8
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,She almost fainted
2,null,null,after bearing adversity so bravely
3,null,null,this happiness proved too much for her
4,surprise,could scarcely believe it,She could scarcely believe it

431 9
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Clients became so numerous that Pascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre
2,null,null,and his rent was consequently doubled
3,null,null,but the income he derived from his profession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs safely invested as a resource against any emergency
4,null,null,Madame Ferailleur now laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband 's death
5,null,null,She felt that she owed it to Pascal
6,null,null,and
7,null,null,besides
8,null,null,after believing there was no more happiness left for her on earth
9,happiness,heart rejoiced,her heart rejoiced  at her son 's success .
432 5
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Faithful to her promise
2,null,null,Madame Ferailleur retired at the usual hour
3,null,null,but she could not sleep
4,fear,anxiety,She certainly had no cause for anxiety
5,null,null,and yet the thought that her son was not at home filled her heart with vague misgivings such as she had never previously felt under similar circumstances .
433 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,What should she do
2,null,null,Her first impulse was to run to the Commissary of Police 's office or to the house of Pascal 's friend
3,null,null,but on the other hand
4,null,null,she dared not go out
5,fear,fear,for fear he might return in her absence
6,null,null,Thus
7,null,null,in an agony of suspense
8,null,null,she waited counting the seconds by the quick throbbing s of her temples
9,null,null,and straining her ears to catch the slightest sound .
434 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,He had barely strength enough to throw himself on to the bed
2,null,null,and in a moment he was sleeping with that heavy slumber which so often seizes hold of one on the occasion of a great crisis
3,null,null,and which has so frequently been observed among persons condemned to death
4,null,null,on the night preceding their execution
5,null,null,Four or five times his mother came to listen at the door

436 13
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,Contrary to his usual custom
2,null,null,he took the little staircase on the right
3,null,null,leading to the grand vestibule
4,null,null,where several lawyers were assembled
5,null,null,earnestly engaged in conversation
6,null,null,They were evidently astonished to see Pascal
7,null,null,and their conversation abruptly ceased on his approach
8,null,null,They assumed a grave look and turned away their heads in disgust
9,null,null,The unfortunate man at once realized the truth
10,null,null,and pressed his hand to his forehead
11,sadness,despairing,with a despairing gesture
12,null,null,as he murmured :   "  Already
13,null,null,already

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Pascal read as follows :   "  There was great sensation and a terrible scandal last night at the residence of Madame d' a
2,null,null,a well-known star of the first magnitude
3,happiness,enjoying,A score of gentlemen of high rank and immense wealth were enjoying a quiet game of baccarat
4,null,null,when it was observed that M
5,null,null,F   was winning in a most extraordinary manner
6,null,null,He was watched and detected in the very act of dexterously slipping some cards into the pack he held .
438 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,and
2,null,null,unfortunately
3,null,null,this prank cannot be attributed to a momentary fit of madness
4,null,null,for the fact that he had provided himself with these cards in advance proves the act to have been premeditated
5,null,null,One of the persons present was especially displeased
6,null,null,This was the Viscount de C
7,null,null,who had introduced M
8,null,null,F   to Madame d' a
9,disgust,annoyed,Extremely annoyed by this contretemps
10,null,null,he took umbrage at an offensive remark made by M
11,null,null,de R
12,null,null,and it was rumored that these gentlemen would cross swords at daybreak this morning .
439 8
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,He little fancied at that supreme moment that each of his gestures
2,null,null,each contraction of his features
3,null,null,were viewed by the mother whose name he faltered
4,null,null,Since her son had left her to go to the Palais de Justice
5,fear,crazy with anxiety,the poor woman had remained almost crazy with anxiety
6,null,null,and when she heard him return and lock himself in his office a thing he had never done before a fearful presentiment was aroused in her mind
7,null,null,Gliding into her son 's bedroom
8,null,null,she at once approached the door communicating with his office .
440 22
 (13, 10),(13, 11),
1,null,null,The upper part of this portal was of glass
2,null,null,it was possible to see what was occurring in the adjoining room
3,null,null,When Madame Ferailleur perceived Pascal seat himself at his desk and begin to write
4,null,null,she felt a trifle reassured
5,null,null,and almost thought of going away
6,null,null,But a vague dread
7,null,null,stronger than reason or will
8,null,null,riveted her to the spot
9,null,null,A few moments later
10,null,null,when she saw the revolver in her son 's hand
11,null,null,she understood everything
12,null,null,Her blood froze in her veins
13,fear,terror,and yet she had sufficient self-control to repress the cry of terror which sprang to her lips
14,null,null,She realized that the danger was terrible
15,null,null,imminent
16,null,null,extreme
17,null,null,Her heart
18,null,null,rather than her bewildered reason
19,null,null,told her that her son 's life hung on a single thread
20,null,null,The slightest sound
21,null,null,a word
22,null,null,a rap on the door might hasten the unfortunate man 's deed .
441 10
 (1, 4),
1,sadness,despondently,He lowered his head despondently
2,null,null,and in a tone of profound discouragement
3,null,null,he replied :   "  But what can I do
4,null,null,How can I escape from the web which has been woven around me with such fiendish cunning
5,null,null,If I had possessed my usual presence of mind at the moment of the accusation
6,null,null,I might have defended and justified myself
7,null,null,perhaps
8,null,null,But now the misfortune is irreparable
9,null,null,How can I unmask the traitor
10,null,null,and what proofs of his guilt can I cast in his face
442 20
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,Pascal was absorbed in thought
2,null,null,"  And what a strange coincidence
3,null,null,"   he eventually remarked
4,null,null,"  Do you know
5,null,null,the last time I saw Marguerite
6,null,null,a week ago
7,null,null,she seemed so sad and anxious that I felt alarmed
8,null,null,I questioned her
9,null,null,but at first she would not answer
10,null,null,After a little while
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,as I insisted
13,null,null,she said :  ' ah
14,null,null,well
15,fear,fear,I fear the count is planning a marriage for me
16,null,null,de Chalusse has not said a word to me on the subject
17,null,null,but he has recently had several long conferences in private with a young man whose father rendered him a great service in former years

4,null,null,in three different tones
5,null,null,"  ah
6,null,null,ah
7,null,null,"   And as no one had offered him a seat
8,null,null,he approached an arm chair and took possession of it
9,null,null,exclaiming
10,null,null,"  You will allow me
11,null,null,I trust
12,null,null,Those stairs have put me in such a state
444 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,So saying he noisily blew his nose
2,null,null,but this did not prevent him from observing the quiet joy of Pascal and his mother
3,null,null,They were amazed
4,happiness,happy,But although these words were calculated to make them feel intensely happy
5,null,null,they still looked at their visitor with distrust
6,null,null,It is not natural for a person to interest himself in other people 's misfortunes
7,null,null,unless he has some special motive for doing so
8,null,null,and what could this singular man 's object be

1,sadness,ashamed,A little ashamed of his indiscretion
2,null,null,the doctor retreated seven or eight steps down the stairs
3,null,null,and then ascended them again
4,null,null,coughing slightly
5,null,null,so as to announce his approach
6,null,null,This time he was heard
7,null,null,for Mademoiselle Marguerite came to the door to meet him
8,null,null,"  Well
9,null,null,"   he inquired .
449 13
 (9, 11),
1,null,null,His lips moved
2,null,null,but only a hollow
3,null,null,rattling sound
4,null,null,which was absolutely unintelligible
5,null,null,came from his throat
6,null,null,Still
7,null,null,he understood her
8,null,null,as it was easy to see by his gesture
9,sadness,despairing,despairing and painful ones
10,null,null,for paralysis had not released its hold on its victim
11,null,null,and it was only with great difficulty that he could slightly move his right arm
12,null,null,He evidently desired something
13,null,null,But what
450 22
 (9, 4),
1,null,null,That was
2,null,null,indeed
3,null,null,what he desired
4,null,null,With the hand that was comparatively free
5,null,null,with the hoarse rattle that was his only voice
6,null,null,de Chalusse answered
7,null,null,"  Yes
8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,with an expression of joy and gratitude,"   and his eyes even turned to Madame Leon with an expression of joy and gratitude
10,null,null,They raised him on his pillows
11,null,null,and brought him a small writing - desk
12,null,null,with some paper
13,null,null,and a pen that had been dipped in ink
14,null,null,But like those around him
15,null,null,he had himself over estimated his strength
16,null,null,if he could move his hand
17,null,null,he could not CONTROL its movements
18,null,null,After a terrible effort and intense suffering
19,null,null,however
20,null,null,he succeeded in tracing a few words
21,null,null,the meaning of which it was impossible to understand
22,null,null,It was only with the greatest difficulty that these words could be deciphered  "  My entire fortune give friends against   "   This signified nothing .
451 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,"  My God
2,null,null,"   exclaimed Mademoiselle Marguerite
3,null,null,with a gesture of despair
4,null,null,"  what have I done
5,null,null,I have broken the key
6,fear,feared,I feared the responsibility which would fall upon us all .  "
452 9
 (5, 2),
1,null,null,There was a moment 's stupor the stupor which always follows death
2,null,null,especially when death comes suddenly and unexpectedly
3,null,null,A feeling of mingled wonder
4,null,null,selfishness
5,fear,fear,and fear pervaded the group of servants
6,null,null,"  Yes
7,null,null,it is over
8,null,null,"   muttered the doctor
9,null,null,"  it is all over
453 5
 (1, 4),
1,fear,despair,The concierge was in despair
2,null,null,"  Heavens
3,null,null,"   he exclaimed
4,null,null,"  so the master 's dead
5,null,null,What a misfortune
454 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,The clerk had been even less disturbed than the magistrate
2,null,null,He also was blase
3,null,null,having witnessed too many of those frightful and shameless dramas which are enacted at a dead man 's bedside
4,surprise,surprised,to be surprised at anything
5,null,null,If he had deigned to glance at the escritoire
6,null,null,it was only because he was curious to see how small a space would suffice to contain two millions
7,null,null,and then he had begun to calculate how many years he would be obliged to remain a clerk before he could succeed in amassing such a fabulous sum .
455 19
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Indeed
2,null,null,he was persuaded he was sure he would
3,null,null,in fact
4,null,null,have sworn that the Count de Chalusse had taken all the precautions natural in childless men
5,null,null,who have no near relatives to inherit their fortune
6,null,null,or who have placed their interest and affections beyond their family circle
7,null,null,And when he was obliged to abandon his search
8,anger,anger,his gesture indicated anger rather than discouragement
9,null,null,for apparent evidence had not shaken his conviction in the least
10,null,null,So he stood motionless
11,null,null,with his eyes riveted on his ring
12,null,null,as if waiting some miraculous inspiration from it
13,null,null,"  For the count 's only fault
14,null,null,I am sure
15,null,null,was in being too cautious
16,null,null,"   he muttered
17,null,null,"  This is frequently the case
18,null,null,and it would be quite in keeping with the character of this man
19,null,null,judging from what I know of him .  "
456 22
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,"  Never
2,null,null,no never
3,null,null,have I seen such a suspicious and distrustful person as he was
4,null,null,Not in reference to money no
5,null,null,indeed for he left that lying about everywhere
6,null,null,but about his papers
7,null,null,He locked them up with the greatest care
8,fear,feared,as if he feared that some terrible secret might evaporate from them
9,null,null,It was a mania with him
10,null,null,If he had a letter to write
11,null,null,he barricaded his door
12,null,null,as if he were about to commit some horrible crime
13,null,null,More than once have I seen him   "   The words died away on her lips
14,null,null,and she remained motionless and abashed
15,null,null,like a person who has just escaped some great peril
16,null,null,One word more
17,null,null,and involuntarily
18,null,null,without even knowing it
19,null,null,she would have confessed her besetting sin
20,null,null,which was listening at
21,null,null,and peering through
22,null,null,the keyholes of the doors that were closed against her .
457 6
 (3, 4),(3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,On hearing these words
2,null,null,the clerk rose with a cloud on his jovial face
3,disgust,impatiently,He impatiently jingled his bunch of keys
4,null,null,for as the seals are successively affixed
5,null,null,each key is confided to the clerk
6,null,null,to remain in his hands until the seals are removed .
458 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,During play time she often took me on her knee and embraced me with convulsive tenderness
2,null,null,murmuring :  ' dear little one
3,null,null,darling little one
4,null,null,' Sometimes her endearments were irksome to me
5,null,null,but I never allowed her to see it
6,sadness,more sad,for fear of making her still more sad
7,null,null,and in my heart I was content and proud to suffer for and with her
8,null,null,Poor sister
9,null,null,I owe her the only happy hours of my infancy
10,null,null,She was called Sister Calliste .
459 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The only fault the sisters found with me was that I was sullen But such was not really the case
2,sadness,depressed and saddened,I was only sad and resigned Everything around me so depressed and saddened me that I withdrew into myself
3,null,null,and buried all my thoughts and aspirations deep in my heart If I had naturally been a bad child
4,null,null,I scarcely know what would have been the result of this I have often asked myself the question in all sincerity
5,null,null,but I have been unable to reply
6,null,null,for one cannot be an impartial judge respecting one 's self
460 15
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,a miserable foundling
2,null,null,reared by public charity for the generosity which this good gentleman and lady showed in offering to take charge of me and employ me in their workshop I must confess that I could not clearly realize in what this great generosity which he so highly praised consisted
3,null,null,nor did I perceive any reason why I should be particularly grateful Still
4,null,null,to all the conditions imposed upon me
5,null,null,I answered
6,null,null,' yes
7,null,null,yes
8,null,null,yes
9,happiness,greatly pleased,' so heartily that Madame Greloux seemed greatly pleased ' it is evident that the child will be glad to get away
10,null,null,' she said to herself Then the superior began to enumerate the obligations my employers would incur
11,null,null,repeating again and again that I was one of the very best girls in the asylum pious
12,null,null,obedient
13,null,null,and industrious
14,null,null,reading and writing to perfection
15,null,null,and knowing how to sew and embroider as only those who are taught in such institutions can
461 11
 (7, 7),(7, 8),
1,null,null,I was so awed that I had scarcely enough presence of mind to bow to him
2,null,null,He glanced at me coldly
3,null,null,and exclaimed :  ' ah
4,null,null,is this the young girl you were speaking of
5,null,null,' The count 's tone betrayed such disagreeable surprise that the superior was dismayed
6,null,null,She looked at me
7,anger,seemed indignant,and seemed indignant at my more than modest attire
8,null,null,' it 's a shame to allow a child to leave home dressed in this fashion
9,null,null,' she angrily exclaimed
10,null,null,And she almost tore my huge apron off me
11,null,null,and then with her own hands began to arrange my hair as if to display me to better advantage .
462 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,"  I timidly asked permission to return to my employers to inform them of what had happened and consult with them
2,null,null,but my request was refused
3,null,null,The superior told me that I must deliberate and decide alone
4,null,null,and that when once my decision was taken
5,null,null,there could be no change
6,null,null,So I remained at the asylum
7,null,null,and dined at the superior 's table
8,null,null,and during the night I occupied the room of a sister who was absent
9,surprise,surprised,What surprised me most of all was the deference with which I was treated
10,null,null,The sisters all seemed to consider me a person of great importance
11,null,null,And yet I hesitated .
463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,null,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,null,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
465 22
 (11, 8),
1,null,null,"  By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own
2,null,null,but he did not speak it
3,null,null,He was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians
4,null,null,and I was often affected to tears by his tenderness
5,null,null,But
6,null,null,although my slightest wish was law
7,null,null,he did not grant me his confidence
8,null,null,the mystery that stood between us was like a wall of ice  Still
9,null,null,I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life
10,null,null,and my mind was regaining its equilibrium
11,disgust,more agitated and excited,when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited
12,null,null,if possible
13,null,null,than on the day of my departure from the asylum
14,null,null,He summoned his valet
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,in a tone that admitted no reply
17,null,null,he exclaimed
18,null,null,' i wish to leave Cannes at once  I must start in less than an hour so procure some post horses instantly
19,null,null,And in answer to my inquiring glance
20,null,null,he said :  ' it must be
21,null,null,It would be folly to hesitate
22,null,null,Each moment increases the peril that threatens us . '
466 18
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,What mysterious freak of fate had caused him to pause there at that particular moment
2,null,null,This much is certain
3,null,null,he recognized me as I had recognized him
4,null,null,He bowed
5,null,null,smiling somewhat
6,null,null,and I fled indoors again
7,anger,indignant with myself,indignant with myself for not being angry at his audacity
8,null,null,I made many plans that day
9,null,null,but the next morning
10,null,null,at the same hour
11,null,null,I hid myself behind a Venetian blind
12,null,null,and saw him pause at the gate
13,null,null,and gaze at the garden with evident anxiety
14,null,null,I soon learned that he lived near by
15,null,null,with his widowed mother
16,null,null,and twice a day
17,null,null,when he went to the Palais de Justice and returned
18,null,null,he passed my home .  "
467 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,null,null,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,fear,feared,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .
468 18
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Her cheeks were crimson now
2,null,null,her eyes were lowered
3,null,null,and she was evidently embarrassed
4,null,null,But suddenly
5,null,null,as if ashamed of her blushes
6,null,null,she proudly raised her head
7,null,null,and said
8,null,null,in a firmer voice :   "  Shall I tell you our simple story
9,null,null,Is it necessary
10,null,null,I should not have concealed anything that has passed from my mother
11,happiness,happy,if I had been so happy as to possess a mother

14,null,null,the pressure of a hand through the garden gate
15,null,null,and that is all
16,null,null,Still
17,null,null,I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault :  I have disobeyed the one rule of my life frankness
18,null,null,and I am cruelly punished for doing so .

10,null,null,I dared not
11,sadness,ashamed,I was ashamed of my cowardice
12,null,null,from day to day I vowed that I would confess everything
13,null,null,and yet I procrastinated

15,null,null,' it shall be done to-morrow
16,null,null,but when the morrow came I said
17,null,null,' i will give myself another day just one more day
18,null,null,Indeed
19,null,null,my courage failed me when I thought of the count 's aristocratic prejudices
20,null,null,and besides
21,null,null,I knew how ambitious he was for my future .
470 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand

 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would certainly have given me
2,null,null,I had his troth
3,null,null,and that sufficed
4,null,null,And it was with a thrill of joy that I said to myself :  ' what does it matter if M
5,anger,angered,de Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive me from his house
6,null,null,It will rather be so much the better
7,null,null,Pascal will protect me . '

2,null,null,with a gesture of intense joy and relief

 (3, 1),
1,null,null,Compelled to submit to this disappointment
2,null,null,he returned to the study
3,sadness,discouraged,but he was evidently discouraged
4,null,null,Although he did not consider the mystery insoluble
5,null,null,far from it
6,null,null,he realized that time and research would be required to arrive at a solution
7,null,null,and that the affair was quite beyond his province
8,null,null,One hope alone remained .

5,surprise,appalled,"  it was only because I was appalled by the audacity of the accusation
6,null,null,How was it possible to make Pascal even SEEM to be guilty of a dishonorable act
7,null,null,This is beyond my powers of comprehension
8,null,null,I am only certain of one thing that he is innocent
9,null,null,If the whole world rose to testify against him
10,null,null,it would not shake my faith in him
11,null,null,and even if he confessed that he was guilty I should be more likely to believe that he was crazed than culpable
478 14
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,She spoke these words with a sort of satisfaction
2,null,null,expecting that the marquis would betray his disappointed covetousness by some significant gesture or exclamation

9,null,null,"  Then I may venture to speak
10,null,null,"   he exclaimed
11,null,null,with unconcealed satisfaction
12,null,null,"  I will speak
13,null,null,mademoiselle
14,null,null,if you will deign to allow me .  "

11,null,null,my dear

8,happiness,be only too glad,I shall be only too glad .  "
483 13
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,So saying he closed the door again
2,sadness,overwhelmed,and Marguerite was so overwhelmed by this last and unexpected misfortune
3,null,null,that she could hardly stagger back to the vehicle
4,null,null,"  Gone
5,null,null,"   she murmured
6,null,null,"  gone
7,null,null,without a thought of me
8,null,null,Or does he believe me to be like all the rest
9,null,null,But I will find him again
10,null,null,That man Fortunat
11,null,null,who ascertained addresses for M
12,null,null,de Chalusse
13,null,null,will find Pascal for me .  "
484 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,compassion,Fortunat took compassion on the man 's embarrassment
2,null,null,"  In short
3,null,null,"   he interrupted
4,null,null,"  you wish to conceal a part of your capital from your creditors
485 19
 (13, 13),
1,null,null,"  Yes
2,null,null,indeed
3,null,null,m ' sieur
4,null,null,And why not
5,null,null,My poor
6,null,null,good mother has n't been able to work for a year
7,null,null,and who would care for her if I didnt
8,null,null,Certainly not my father
9,null,null,the good-for-nothing scamp
10,null,null,who squandered all the Duke de Sairmeuse 's money without giving us a sou of it
11,null,null,Besides
12,null,null,im like other men
13,fear,anxious,im anxious to be rich
14,null,null,and enjoy myself
15,null,null,I should like to ride in my carriage like other people do
16,null,null,And whenever a gamin
17,null,null,such as I was once
18,null,null,opened the door for ME
19,null,null,I should put a five franc piece in his hand   "
486 15
 (10, 11),
1,null,null,He had expected to find  "  his dear extortion er "   exasperated by his loss
2,null,null,cursing and swearing
3,null,null,and demanding his money but not at all
4,null,null,He found him more gentle and calm
5,null,null,colder and more reserved than ever
6,null,null,brimful of resignation indeed
7,null,null,and preaching submission to the inevitable
8,null,null,"  What can this mean
9,null,null,"   he thought
10,fear,with an anxious heart,with an anxious heart
11,null,null,"  What mischief is the scoundrel plotting now
12,null,null,i 'd wager a thousand to one that he 's forging some thunderbolt to crush me
13,null,null,And
14,null,null,in a haughty tone
15,null,null,he said aloud :
487 19
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But M
2,null,null,Fortunat had resolved to listen to nothing
3,null,null,He wished for no explanations
4,fear,fear,so distrustful was he of himself so much did he fear that his adventurous nature would urge him to incur further risk
5,null,null,He was positively afraid of the Marquis de Valorsay 's eloquence
6,null,null,besides
7,null,null,he knew well enough that the person who consents to listen is at least half convinced
8,null,null,"  Tell me nothing
9,null,null,monsieur
10,null,null,"   he hastily answered
11,null,null,"  it would be useless
12,null,null,I have n't the money
13,null,null,If I had given you ten thousand francs last night
14,null,null,I should have been compelled to borrow them of M
15,null,null,Prosper Bertomy
16,null,null,And even if I had the money
17,null,null,I should still say ' Impossible
18,null,null,Every man has his system his theory
19,null,null,you know .
488 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Victory perched upon the agent 's banner
2,happiness,with a feeling of pride,and it was with a feeling of pride that he saw his noble client depart
3,null,null,white and speechless with rage
4,null,null,"  What a rascal that marquis is
5,null,null,"   he muttered
6,null,null,"  I would certainly warn Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,poor girl
8,null,null,if I were not so much afraid of him .  "
489 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,As he received high wages
2,null,null,he served passably well
3,null,null,but he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count
4,null,null,He scented some great family secret in the household
5,anger,angry and humiliated,and he felt angry and humiliated that this secret had not been entrusted to his discretion
6,null,null,And if he had discovered nothing
7,null,null,it was because M
8,null,null,de Chalusse had been caution personified
9,null,null,as Madame Leon had declared .
490 18
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,With total disregard of prudence
2,null,null,he talked with inexcusable freedom of the Count de Chalusse
3,null,null,and M
4,null,null,de Valorsay
5,null,null,and especially of his enemy
6,null,null,Mademoiselle Marguerite
7,null,null,"  For it is she
8,anger,exclaimed,"   he exclaimed
9,null,null,rapping on the table with his knife  "  it is she who has taken the missing millions
10,null,null,How she did it
11,null,null,no one will ever know
12,null,null,for she has not an equal in craftiness
13,null,null,but it 's she who has stolen them
14,null,null,im sure of it
15,null,null,I would have taken my oath to that effect before the magistrate
16,null,null,and I would have proved it
17,null,null,too
18,null,null,if he had not taken her part because she 's pretty for she is devilishly pretty .  "
491 23
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,Once more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark :   "  There it is again sufficient to live upon
2,null,null,and I expect to receive it from you
3,null,null,Excellent
4,null,null,Women are remarkable creatures
5,null,null,upon my word
6,null,null,But listen to the rest
7,null,null,' it is absolutely necessary that I should see you as soon as possible
8,null,null,Oblige me
9,null,null,therefore
10,null,null,by calling to-morrow
11,null,null,October 15th
12,null,null,at the Hotel de Homburg
13,null,null,in the Rue du Helder
14,null,null,You will ask for Madame Lucy Huntley
15,null,null,and they will conduct you to me
16,null,null,I shall expect you from three o'clock to six
17,null,null,Come
18,null,null,I implore you
19,null,null,come
20,sadness,painful,It is painful to me to add that if I do not hear from you
21,null,null,I am resolved to demand and OBTAIN no matter what may be the consequences the means which I have
22,null,null,so far
23,null,null,asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands
492 22
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Having finished the letter
2,null,null,Casimir laid it on the table
3,null,null,and poured out a glass full of brandy
4,null,null,which he drained at a single draught
5,null,null,"  And that 's all
6,null,null,"   he remarked
7,null,null,"  No signature not even an initial
8,null,null,It was a so-called respectable woman who wrote that
9,null,null,They never sign their notes
10,null,null,the hussies
11,fear,fear,for fear of compromising themselves
12,null,null,as i 've reason to know
13,null,null,And so saying
14,null,null,he laughed the idiotic laugh of a man who has been drinking immoderate ly
15,null,null,"  If I had time
16,null,null,"   he resumed
17,null,null,"  I should make some inquiries about this Madame Lucy Huntley a feigned name
18,null,null,evidently
19,null,null,I should like to know   But what 's the matter with you
20,null,null,Monsieur Fortunat
21,null,null,You are as pale as death
22,null,null,Are you ill
493 14
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,Fortunat sprang nimbly on to the pavement
2,null,null,and handed five francs to the coachman
3,disgust,growling and swearing,who went off growling and swearing for he thought the reward a contemptible small one
4,null,null,coming as it did from a man whose life had been saved
5,null,null,according to his own confession
6,null,null,However
7,null,null,the person the Jehu anathematized certainly did not hear him
8,null,null,Standing motionless where he had alighted
9,null,null,Fortunat scrutinized the house in front of him with close attention
10,null,null,"  So she lives here
11,null,null,"   he muttered
12,null,null,"  This is the place
13,null,null,but I cant present myself without knowing her name
14,null,null,I must make some inquiries .  "
494 9
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,It is needless to say that M
2,sadness,moved with sympathy,Fortunat was moved with sympathy
3,null,null,he always evinced a respectful sympathy for the woes of others
4,null,null,but in the present instance
5,null,null,his emotion was greatly mitigated by the satisfaction he felt at having succeeded so quickly and so completely
6,null,null,Madame d' argeles had confessed everything
7,null,null,This was indeed a victory
8,null,null,for it must be admitted that he had trembled lest she should deny all
9,null,null,and bid him leave the house .
495 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Fortunat did not know what to reply
2,surprise,surprise,The question took him completely by surprise
3,null,null,and feeling that his answer would have a very considerable influence upon what might follow
4,null,null,he hesitated .
496 17
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The dismissal was so imperious that M
2,null,null,Fortunat bowed and went off
3,null,null,completely bewildered by this denouement
4,null,null,"  She 's crazy
5,null,null,"   he said to himself
6,null,null,"  Crazy in the fullest sense of the word
7,fear,fear,She refuses the count 's millions from a silly fear of telling people that she belongs to the Chalusse family
8,null,null,She threatened her brother
9,null,null,but she would never have carried her threats into execution
10,null,null,And she prefers her present position to such a fortune
11,null,null,What lunacy
12,null,null,"   But
13,null,null,although he was disappointed and angry
14,null,null,he did not by any means despair
15,null,null,"  Fortunately for me
16,null,null,"   he thought
17,null,null,"  this proud and haughty lady has a son somewhere in the world .
497 6
 (3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,One afternoon
2,null,null,when Bruno came home from school
3,surprise,surprised,he was surprised to find Maria
4,null,null,the family 's maid who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet standing in his bedroom
5,null,null,pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates
6,null,null,even the things he 'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else 's business .
498 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,' what are you doing
2,null,null,' he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster
3,sadness,wasnt happy,for although he wasnt happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions
4,null,null,his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the Way Father spoke to her
5,null,null,' you take your hands off my things . '
499 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars
2,null,null,the butler
3,null,null,was in there
4,null,null,packing her things too
5,sadness,sighed,She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase
6,null,null,followed by Bruno
7,null,null,who wasnt going to let the matter drop without an explanation .
500 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived
2,null,null,He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she could n't have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual
3,sadness,crying,like his own after he 'd been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying .
501 14
 (12, 3),(12, 8),(12, 9),(12, 10),(12, 11),
1,null,null,' what is
2,null,null,' he asked
3,null,null,' am I being sent away
4,null,null,'	' no
5,null,null,not just you
6,null,null,' she said
7,null,null,looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it
8,null,null,We all are
9,null,null,Your father and I
10,null,null,Gretel and you
11,null,null,All four of us
12,sadness,frowned,Bruno thought about this and frowned
13,null,null,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
14,null,null,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .
502 2
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,wasnt particularly bothered,He wasnt particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him
2,null,null,But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her .
503 10
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,' and we all have to go too
2,null,null,' asked Bruno
3,null,null,Of course we do
4,null,null,' said Mother
5,null,null,' you would n't want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there
6,null,null,would you
7,null,null,'	' i suppose not
8,null,null,' said Bruno
9,sadness,miss,Father would miss us all terribly if we were n't with him
10,null,null,' she added .
504 5
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,sighed,Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again
2,null,null,It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total
3,null,null,if you included the basement
4,null,null,where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you were n't supposed to use
5,null,null,And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly .
505 9
 (3, 7),(3, 8),
1,null,null,' oh my
2,null,null,' said Mother with a laugh
3,sadness,didnt look happy,although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didnt look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didnt want him to see her face
4,null,null,' yes
5,null,null,Bruno
6,null,null,' she said
7,null,null,' it 's more than a mile away
8,null,null,Quite a lot more than that
9,null,null,in fact . '
506 8
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Bruno 's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O
2,surprise,surprised,He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something surprised him
3,null,null,' you dont mean we 're leaving Berlin
4,null,null,' he asked
5,null,null,gasping for air as he got the words out
6,null,null,' im afraid so
7,null,null,' said Mother
8,null,null,nodding her head sadly .
507 8

8,null,null,' he continued
9,null,null,his voice coming dangerously close to shouting

512 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,' bruno
2,null,null,that 's enough
3,null,null,' she said
4,null,null,snapping at him now and standing up to show him that she was serious when she said that was enough
5,null,null,' honestly
6,sadness,complaining,only last week you were complaining about how much things have changed here recently . '
513 11
 (10, 7),
1,null,null,' everyone has to do that
2,null,null,' said Mother
3,null,null,' it keeps us safe
4,null,null,And who knows
5,null,null,maybe we 'll be in less danger if we move away
6,null,null,Now
7,null,null,I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing
8,null,null,We dont have as much time to prepare as I would have liked
9,null,null,thanks to some people
10,sadness,sadly,Bruno nodded and walked away sadly
11,null,null,knowing that  ' some people ' was a grown-up 's word for ' father ' and one that he wasnt supposed to use himself .
514 3
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,When he first saw their new house Bruno 's eyes opened wide
2,surprise,his mouth  made the shape of an O,his mouth  made the shape of an O and his arms stretched out at his sides once again
3,null,null,Everything about it seemed to be the exact opposite of their old home and he could n't believe that they were really going to live there .
515 2
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,no one ever laughed,But there was something about the new house that  made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there
2,null,null,that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about .
516 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him
2,anger,shout and scream,something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days
3,null,null,or just make him burst into tears instead .

518 9
 (2, 3),(2, 4),(2, 5),(2, 6),
1,null,null,He could n't understand how this had all come about
2,happiness,content,One day he was perfectly content
3,null,null,playing at home
4,null,null,having three best friends for life
5,null,null,sliding down banisters
6,null,null,trying to stand on his tiptoes to see right across Berlin
7,null,null,and now he was stuck here in this cold
8,null,null,nasty house with three whispering maids and a waiter who was both unhappy and angry
9,null,null,where no one looked as if they could ever be cheerful again .
519 5
 (5, 2),
1,null,null,' bruno
2,null,null,I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now
3,null,null,' said Mother in an unfriendly voice
4,null,null,and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word
5,sadness,tears,He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he would n't allow them to appear .
520 8
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father 's room opening slightly
2,fear,froze,He froze
3,null,null,unable to move for a moment
4,null,null,Mother was still downstairs
5,null,null,which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said
6,null,null,He watched the door
7,null,null,hardly daring to breathe
8,null,null,wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking to .
521 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,' one
2,null,null,of your father 's soldiers
3,null,null,I suppose
4,null,null,' said Maria
5,null,null,who had stood up very straight when the young man appeared and held her hands before her like a person in prayer
6,null,null,She had stared down at the ground rather than at his face
7,fear,afraid,as if she was afraid she might be turned to stone if she looked directly at him
8,null,null,she only relaxed when he had gone
9,null,null,' we 'll get to know them in time . '
522 5
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,' i dont see what else there is to do other than that
2,sadness,sadly,' said Bruno sadly
3,null,null,' i dont even think there 's going to be anyone to play with other than Gretel
4,null,null,and what fun is that after all
5,null,null,She 's a Hopeless Case . '

6,sadness,cry,He felt as if he was about to cry again but stopped himself
7,null,null,not wanting to look like a baby in front of Maria
8,null,null,He looked around the room without fully lifting his eyes up from the ground
9,null,null,trying to see whether there was anything of interest to be found .
524 5
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,He ran into Gretel 's room without knocking and discovered her placing her civilization of dolls on various shelves around the room
2,null,null,' what are you doing in here
3,anger,shouted,' she shouted
4,null,null,spinning round
5,null,null,dont you know you dont enter a lady 's room without knocking
525 9

527 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,' of course
2,null,null,' said Gretel
3,null,null,who always spoke of Father as if he could never do any wrong and never got angry and always came in to kiss her goodnight before she went to sleep which
4,sadness,sad,if Bruno was to be really fair and not just sad about moving houses
5,null,null,he would have admitted Father did for him too .

4,null,null,and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether
5,null,null,During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence
6,null,null,nor did he find any doors to let him inside
7,sadness,despair,and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful
8,null,null,In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see
9,null,null,the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space .
603 6

1,null,null,He stared at the boy and considered asking him why he looked so sad but hesitated because he thought it might sound rude
2,fear,sad,He knew that sometimes people who were sad didnt want to be asked about it
3,null,null,sometimes they 'd offer the information themselves and sometimes they would n't stop talking about it for months on end
4,null,null,but on this occasion Bruno thought that he should wait before saying anything
5,null,null,He had discovered something during his exploration
6,null,null,and now that he was finally talking to one of the people on the other side of the fence it seemed like a good idea to make the most of the opportunity .

6,happiness,proud,He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them
7,null,null,even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk
8,null,null,All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant
9,null,null,all the same
10,null,null,because Bruno and Gretel were n't even invited to dinner

3,null,null,and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent
4,null,null,but had not noticed his leaving it
5,null,null,she took up her belt and perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone .
740 8
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back
2,null,null,She waited for him till evening rather impatiently
3,null,null,and wondering what could have kept him from her so long
4,null,null,When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly
5,sadness,grief,In spite of her grief and anxiety however
6,null,null,she did not lose her presence of mind
7,null,null,but decided on a courageous
8,null,null,though very unusual step .

 (6, 6),
1,null,null,The prince
2,null,null,who had watched the whole scene with much interest
3,null,null,now drew near the spot where it happened
4,null,null,and glancing at the dead bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its inside
5,null,null,He picked it up
6,surprise,surprise,and what was his surprise when he recognised the Princess Badoura 's talisman which had been the cause of many misfortunes
7,null,null,It would be impossible to describe his joy
8,null,null,he kissed the talisman repeatedly
9,null,null,wrapped it up
10,null,null,and carefully tied it round his arm
11,null,null,For the first time since his separation from the princess he had a good night
12,null,null,and next morning he was up at day break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do .
743 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He then led the gardener to the cave
2,null,null,and having shown him the treasure stored up there
3,happiness,happy,said how happy it made him that Heaven should in this way reward his kind host 's many virtues and compensate him for the privations of many years .
744 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune
2,null,null,which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country
3,null,null,Moreover
4,null,null,he had once more lost the Princess Badoura 's talisman
5,fear,feared,which he feared he might never see again
6,null,null,There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done
7,null,null,and to live on in the cottage
8,null,null,As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself
9,null,null,he engaged a lad to help him
10,null,null,and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars
11,null,null,filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport .
745 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,"  Alas
2,null,null,Sire
3,sadness,sad,I bring sad news to your Majesty
4,null,null,There can be no doubt that the prince has completely lost his senses
5,null,null,He declares that he saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night
6,null,null,and the state you see me in proves how violent contradiction makes him
7,null,null,He then gave a minute account of all the prince had said and done .
746 1
 (1, 1),
1,anger,angry,"  I feel really very angry with your slave for alarming his Majesty by the news he brought him .  "
747 8
 (6, 8),
1,null,null,The emir accepted the condition
2,null,null,and the king led him to the princess
3,null,null,who
4,null,null,veiling her face
5,null,null,remarked
6,surprise,surprised,"  I am surprised
7,null,null,sire
8,null,null,that you should bring an unknown man into my presence "   .
748 6
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,Now it happened that after things had been going on in this way for some time the nurse 's son Marzavan returned from his travels
2,null,null,He had been in many countries and learnt many things
3,null,null,including astrology
4,sadness,sad,Needless to say that one of the first things his mother told him was the sad condition of the princess
5,null,null,his foster sister
6,null,null,Marzavan asked if she could not manage to let him see the princess without the king 's knowledge .
749 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  If what you tell me
2,null,null,Princess
3,null,null,is indeed the case
4,sadness,despair,I do not despair of finding comfort for you
5,null,null,Take patience yet a little longer
6,null,null,I will set out at once to explore other countries
7,null,null,and when you hear of my return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far off
8,null,null,So saying
9,null,null,he took his leave and started next morning on his travels .
750 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  Now is the time to perform your promise
2,disgust,impatient,I am so impatient to see my beloved princess once more that I am sure I shall fall ill again if we do not start soon
3,null,null,The one obstacle is my father 's tender care of me
4,null,null,for
5,null,null,as you may have noticed
6,null,null,he cannot bear me out of his sight .  "
751 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making his request
2,fear,fear,and the king gladly granted it on condition that only one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue after such a long illness .
752 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In answer to Camaralzaman 's inquiries as to the reason for this
2,null,null,Marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their journey was to divert attention by creating the idea of the prince 's death
3,null,null,"  Your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief
4,null,null,"   he went on
5,happiness,joy,"  but his joy at your return will be all the greater .  "
753 11
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,despair,The prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to think whether he had better return to the camp
2,null,null,"  But
3,null,null,"   thought he
4,null,null,"  how shall I find my way back
5,null,null,Must I go up hill or down
6,null,null,I should certainly lose my way in the dark
7,null,null,even if my strength held out
8,null,null,Overwhelmed by hunger
9,null,null,thirst
10,null,null,fatigue and sleep
11,null,null,he ended by spending the night at the foot of the tree .
754 23
 (14, 14),
1,null,null,My brother
2,null,null,although the old woman was a stranger to him
3,null,null,did not hesitate to do as she wished
4,null,null,He gave her a vessel of water and then went back to his place and his thoughts
5,null,null,and with his mind busy over his last adventure
6,null,null,he put his gold into a long and narrow purse
7,null,null,which he could easily carry in his belt
8,null,null,During this time the old woman was busy over her prayers
9,null,null,and when she had finished she came and prostrated herself twice before my brother
10,null,null,and then rising called down endless blessings on his head
11,null,null,Observing her shabby clothes
12,null,null,my brother thought that her gratitude was in reality a hint that he should give her some money to buy some new ones
13,null,null,so he held out two pieces of gold
14,surprise,surprise,The old woman started back in surprise as if she had received an insult
15,null,null,"  Good heavens
16,null,null,"   she exclaimed
17,null,null,"  what is the meaning of this
18,null,null,Is it possible that you take me
19,null,null,my lord
20,null,null,for one of those miserable creatures who force their way into houses to beg for alms
21,null,null,Take back your money
22,null,null,I am thankful to say I do not need it
23,null,null,for I belong to a beautiful lady who is very rich and gives me everything I want .  "
755 16
 (6, 6),(6, 7),
1,null,null,The judge
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,would say nothing about this
4,null,null,and lost no time in sending men to fetch away all that Alnaschar had taken from the house
5,null,null,When everything had been moved and placed under his roof he ordered my brother to leave the town and never more to enter it on peril of his life
6,fear,fearing,fearing that if he returned he might seek justice from the Caliph
7,null,null,Alnaschar obeyed
8,null,null,and was on his way to a neighbouring city when he fell in with a band of robbers
9,null,null,who stripped him of his clothes and left him naked by the roadside
10,null,null,Hearing of his plight
11,null,null,I hurried after him to console him for his misfortunes
12,null,null,and to dress him in my best robe
13,null,null,I then brought him back disguised
14,null,null,under cover of night
15,null,null,to my house
16,null,null,where I have since given him all the care I bestow on my other brothers .
756 41
 (15, 14),
1,null,null,For two months I hunted thus
2,null,null,and no day passed without my securing
3,null,null,an elephant
4,null,null,Of course I did not always station myself in the same tree
5,null,null,but sometimes in one place
6,null,null,sometimes in another
7,null,null,One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised to see that
8,null,null,instead of passing the tree I was in
9,null,null,as they usually did
10,null,null,they paused
11,null,null,and completely surrounded it
12,null,null,trumpeting horribly
13,null,null,and shaking the very ground with their heavy tread
14,null,null,and when I saw that their eyes were fixed upon me
15,fear,was terrified,I was terrified
16,null,null,and my arrows dropped from my trembling hand
17,null,null,I had indeed good reason for my terror when
18,null,null,an instant later
19,null,null,the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree
20,null,null,and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots
21,null,null,bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches
22,null,null,I thought now that my last hour was surely come
23,null,null,but the huge creature
24,null,null,picking me up gently enough
25,null,null,set me upon its back
26,null,null,where I clung more dead than alive
27,null,null,and followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest
28,null,null,It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant
29,null,null,and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd
30,null,null,which turned and trampled off in another direction
31,null,null,and were soon hidden in the dense underwood
32,null,null,Then
33,null,null,recovering myself
34,null,null,I looked about me
35,null,null,and found that I was standing upon the side of a great hill
36,null,null,strewn as far as I could see on either hand with bones and tusks of elephants
37,null,null,"  This then must be the elephants ' burying place
38,null,null,"   I said to myself
39,null,null,"  and they must have brought me here that I might cease to persecute them
40,null,null,seeing that I want nothing but their tusks
41,null,null,and here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime .  "
757 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,"  Ah
2,null,null,poor Sindbad
3,null,null,"   he cried
4,null,null,"  I was wondering what could have become of you
5,null,null,When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted
6,null,null,and the arrows lying beside it
7,fear,feared,and I feared I should never see you again
8,null,null,Pray tell me how you escaped death .  "
758 15
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,So saying he struck him several hard blows
2,null,null,The corpse fell on the floor
3,null,null,but the man only redoubled his blows
4,null,null,till at length it occurred to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and make no resistance
5,null,null,Then
6,null,null,finding he was quite dead
7,fear,fear,a cold fear took possession of him
8,null,null,"  Wretch that I am
9,null,null,"   said he
10,null,null,"  I have murdered a man
11,null,null,Ah
12,null,null,my revenge has gone too far
13,null,null,Without tho help of Allah I am undone
14,null,null,Cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin
15,null,null,And already he felt the rope round his neck .
759 19
 (14, 14),
1,null,null,In this same island we saw the rhinoceros
2,null,null,an animal which is smaller than the elephant and larger than the buffalo
3,null,null,It has one horn about a cubit long which is solid
4,null,null,but has a furrow from the base to the tip
5,null,null,Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man
6,null,null,The rhinoceros fights with the elephant
7,null,null,and transfixing him with his horn carries him off upon his head
8,null,null,but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy
9,null,null,he falls helpless to the ground
10,null,null,and then comes the roc
11,null,null,and clutches them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young
12,null,null,This doubtless astonishes you
13,null,null,but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself
14,fear,fear,For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful things which we saw in this island
15,null,null,Before we left I exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited greatly on our homeward way
16,null,null,At last we reached Balsora
17,null,null,whence I hastened to Bagdad
18,null,null,where my first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor
19,null,null,after which I settled down to enjoy tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain .
760 5
 (1, 2),
1,surprise,surprised,At this I was greatly surprised
2,null,null,but looking carefully at him I recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made my second voyage
3,null,null,though he had altered much since that time
4,null,null,As for him
5,null,null,believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognised me .
761 38
 (30, 30),
1,null,null,At daylight we wandered inland
2,null,null,and soon saw some huts
3,null,null,to which we directed our steps
4,null,null,As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us
5,null,null,and we were led to their houses
6,null,null,and as it were divided among our captors
7,null,null,I with five others was taken into a hut
8,null,null,where we were made to sit upon the ground
9,null,null,and certain herbs were given to us
10,null,null,which the blacks made signs to us to eat
11,null,null,Observing that they themselves did not touch them
12,null,null,I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion
13,null,null,but my companions
14,null,null,being very hungry
15,null,null,rashly ate up all that was set before them
16,null,null,and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad
17,null,null,Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said
18,null,null,nor did they heed when I spoke to them
19,null,null,The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil
20,null,null,of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly
21,null,null,but I only tasted a few grains
22,null,null,understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating
23,null,null,and this was exactly what happened
24,null,null,My unlucky companions having lost their reason
25,null,null,felt neither anxiety nor fear
26,null,null,and ate greedily all that was offered them
27,null,null,So they were soon fat and there was an end of them
28,null,null,but I grew leaner day by day
29,null,null,for I ate but little
30,fear,fear,and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me
31,null,null,However
32,null,null,as I was so far from being a tempting morsel
33,null,null,I was allowed to wander about freely
34,null,null,and one day
35,null,null,when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me
36,null,null,I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest
37,null,null,running faster the more he cried to me to come back
38,null,null,until I had completely distanced him .
762 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons
2,fear,feared,and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad
3,null,null,so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street
4,null,null,However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of
5,null,null,and urged him to obey the call so pressing ly that at last the porter was obliged to yield .
763 28
 (24, 24),
1,null,null,From time to time we landed at various islands
2,null,null,where we sold or exchanged our merchandise
3,null,null,and one day
4,null,null,when the wind dropped suddenly
5,null,null,we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow
6,null,null,which only rose slightly above the surface of the water
7,null,null,Our sails were furled
8,null,null,and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves
9,null,null,I was among the number
10,null,null,but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us
11,null,null,we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island
12,null,null,while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives
13,null,null,since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale
14,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
15,null,null,others sprang into the sea
16,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
17,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
18,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
19,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
20,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
21,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
22,null,null,now beaten this way
23,null,null,now that
24,sadness,despaired,and when night fell I despaired for my life
25,null,null,but
26,null,null,weary and spent as I was
27,null,null,I clung to my frail support
28,null,null,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island .
764 14
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,How long I slept I know not
2,null,null,but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone
3,null,null,I rushed to and fro like one distracted
4,sadness,despair,uttering cries of despair
5,null,null,and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon
6,null,null,I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety
7,null,null,But since wishes could do me no good
8,null,null,I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape
9,null,null,When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,finding nothing hopeful there
12,null,null,I turned landward
13,null,null,and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object
14,null,null,so far off that I could not make out what it might be .
765 25
 (2, 19),(20, 19),
1,null,null,Persecuted by ill fortune
2,sadness,grief,and stricken with grief
3,null,null,there seemed to be only one means of safety left to me
4,null,null,I shaved my beard and my eyebrows
5,null,null,and put on the dress of a calender
6,null,null,in which it was easy for me to travel without being known
7,null,null,I avoided the towns till I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph
8,null,null,haroun al raschid
9,null,null,when I had no further reason to fear my enemies
10,null,null,It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness
11,null,null,who would
12,null,null,I felt certain
13,null,null,be touched by my sad story
14,null,null,and would grant me
15,null,null,besides
16,null,null,his help and protection
17,null,null,hat you ask is impossible
18,null,null,"   she answered
19,null,null,"  but stay here with me instead
20,sadness,happy,and we can be happy
21,null,null,and all you will have to do is to betake yourself to the forest every tenth day
22,null,null,when I am expecting my master the genius
23,null,null,He is very jealous
24,null,null,as you know
25,null,null,and will not suffer a man to come near me .  "
766 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,"  Princess
2,null,null,"   I replied
3,fear,fear,"  I see it is only fear of the genius that makes you act like this
4,null,null,For myself
5,null,null,I dread him so little that I mean to break his talisman in pieces
6,null,null,Awful though you think him
7,null,null,he shall feel the weight of my arm
8,null,null,and I herewith take a solemn vow to stamp out the whole race .  "

768 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,One after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll
2,null,null,and when they had all finished
3,null,null,I came forward
4,null,null,and snatched the paper from the man who held it
5,null,null,At first they all thought I was going to throw it into the sea
6,null,null,but they were quieted when they saw I held it with great care
7,surprise,surprise,and great was their surprise when I made signs that I too wished to write something .
769 25
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,I was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she did not give me time
2,null,null,Turning to the Sultan
3,null,null,her father
4,null,null,she said
5,null,null,"  Sire
6,null,null,I have gained the battle
7,null,null,but it has cost me dear
8,null,null,The fire has penetrated to my heart
9,null,null,and I have only a few moments to live
10,null,null,This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest
11,null,null,It was the last struggle of the genius
12,null,null,and up to that time I was quite safe
13,null,null,But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire
14,null,null,and in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I knew more than he did
15,null,null,He is dead and in ashes
16,null,null,but my own death is approaching fast
17,null,null,"  My daughter
18,null,null,"   cried the Sultan
19,null,null,"  how sad is my condition
20,surprise,surprised,I am only surprised I am alive at all
21,null,null,The eunuch is consumed by the flames
22,null,null,and the prince whom you have delivered has lost the sight of one eye
23,null,null,He could say no more
24,null,null,for sobs choked his voice
25,null,null,and we all wept together .
770 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain
2,null,null,I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow
3,null,null,Then
4,fear,fearing,fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father
5,null,null,I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase
6,null,null,and quitting the underground chamber
7,null,null,made everything fast as before .
771 7
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,The prince could hardly believe his ears
2,null,null,and rode off as hard as he could
3,null,null,He found his way
4,null,null,and arrived safe and sound at his father 's house
5,null,null,where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grand vizir 's carelessness
6,anger,angry,The king was very angry
7,null,null,and had him strangled immediately .

1,null,null,The porter looked about him
2,null,null,noticing and admiring everything
3,null,null,but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne
4,null,null,who was even more beautiful than the other two
5,null,null,By the respect shown to her by the others
6,null,null,he judged that she must be the eldest
7,null,null,and in this he was right
8,null,null,This lady 's name was Zobeida
9,null,null,the porteress was Sadie

14,null,null,and when it was emptied
15,null,null,paid him handsomely for its use
16,null,null,But instead of taking up his basket and going away
17,null,null,the man still lingered
18,null,null,till Zobeida inquired what he was waiting for
19,null,null,and if he expected more money
20,null,null,"  Oh
21,null,null,madam
22,null,null,"   returned he
23,null,null,"  you have already given me too much
24,fear,fear,and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my departure at once
25,null,null,But
26,null,null,if you will pardon my saying so
27,null,null,I was lost in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves
28,null,null,A company of women without men is
29,null,null,however
30,null,null,as dull as a company of men without women

4,null,null,When he felt very hot he stopped playing
5,null,null,and went back to the palace

7,null,null,and did all that the physician had said
8,null,null,The next day when he arose he found
9,happiness,joy,to his great joy and astonishment

11,null,null,When he entered his audience chamber all his courtiers

4,null,null,though in reality he was bright . The other children called him a  "  sissy
5,null,null,"   mistaking his conscientiousness for cowardice  .  This grieved him very much
6,null,null,and his father undertook to educate him in  "  rough "   ways

1,null,null,The anger emotion is aroused by a thwarting of the instincts and purposes
2,null,null,and in the main the strongly egoistic are those most given to explosive or chronic anger . The angry feeling

4,null,null,must be controlled
5,anger,anger,else failure or social dislike awaits the choleric  .  When a man wins success he frequently allows himself the luxury of indulging his anger because he feels his power cannot be challenged  .  The Duchess in  "  Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland
6,null,null,"   with her choleric  "  off with his head "   whenever any one contradicted her
7,null,null,is a caricature
8,null,null,and a very apt one
9,null,null,of this type of person . We think of the bull necked Henry the Eighth  "  bluff King Hal "   as the choleric type
10,null,null,though here we also assume a certain cyclothymia
11,null,null,great good nature alternating with fierce anger
784 11

5,null,null,"   Akin to anger
6,null,null,akin to fear
7,null,null,is suspicion . There is a sullen non-social personality type whose reactions are characterized by suspicion . He never willingly gives his trust to any one
8,null,null,and when he hands over his destinies to any one
9,null,null,as all must do now and then
10,null,null,he is consumed with dread
11,null,null,doubt and latent hostility

2,null,null,in the masochistic sense spoken of before
3,null,null,Is his humility a sign of inversion
4,null,null,in the Freudian sense
5,null,null,a sort of homosexuality
6,null,null,Possibly
7,null,null,and there are very crude and coarse phrases of the common man indicating a sexual feeling in all victory and defeat . But I am inclined to call this a sort of monothymia
8,null,null,a mood of fear and negative self feeling coloring all the reactions . I have previously cited the case of the man obsessed by fear in all the relations of life
9,null,null,shrinking
10,null,null,self acknowledged inferiority who lost it with  "  a few drinks under my belt
11,fear,fear,"  Dutch courage "   drove from many a man the inferiority and the fear that plagued his soul . True
12,null,null,it drove him into a worse situation
13,null,null,but for a few moments he tasted something of the life that heroes and the great have . If we can ever find something that will not degrade as it exalts

4,null,null,He went to open it
5,null,null,and was immediately seized by the captain and sailors

6,null,null,he spent the day in a secluded garden where he was not known

7,null,null,in order to do this

17,null,null,he did not lose his head

18,null,null,but I would give half a sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design
19,null,null,Went home early and bought some more enamel paint - black this time - and spent the evening touching up the fender
20,null,null,picture frames
21,null,null,and an old pair of boots
22,null,null,making them look as good as new
23,null,null,Also painted Gowing 's walking stick
24,null,null,which he left behind
25,null,null,and made it look like ebony .
809 17
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The last time it was the greengrocer 's boy
2,null,null,who
3,null,null,not seeing it was me
4,null,null,for Sarah had not lighted the gas
5,null,null,pushed into my hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal blocks
6,null,null,I indignantly threw them on the ground
7,anger,annoyed,and felt so annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy 's ears
8,null,null,He went away crying
9,null,null,and said he should summons me
10,null,null,a thing I would not have happen for the world
11,null,null,In the dark
12,null,null,I stepped on a piece of the cabbage
13,null,null,which brought me down on the flags all of a heap
14,null,null,For a moment I was stunned
15,null,null,but when I recovered I crawled upstairs into the drawing-room and on looking into the chimney glass discovered that my chin was bleeding
16,null,null,my shirt smeared with the coal blocks
17,null,null,and my left trouser torn at the knee .
810 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,July 31
2,null,null,- Carrie was very pleased with the bangle
3,null,null,which I left with an affectionate note on her dressing table last night before going to bed
4,null,null,I told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next Saturday
5,null,null,She replied quite happily that she did not mind
6,null,null,except that the weather was so bad
7,fear,feared,and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get her a seaside dress in time
8,null,null,I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with pink bows looked quite good enough
9,null,null,and Carrie said she should not think of wearing it
10,null,null,I was about to discuss the matter
11,null,null,when
12,null,null,remembering the argument yesterday
13,null,null,resolved to hold my tongue .
811 21
 (16, 16),
1,null,null,November 13
2,null,null,- Carrie sent out invitations to Gowing
3,null,null,the Cummings
4,null,null,to Mr
5,null,null,and Mrs
6,null,null,James ( of Sutton )
7,null,null,and Mr
8,null,null,Stillbrook
9,null,null,I wrote a note to Mr
10,null,null,Franching
11,null,null,of Peckham
12,null,null,Carrie said we may as well make it a nice affair
13,null,null,and why not ask our principal
14,null,null,Mr
15,null,null,Perkupp
16,fear,feared,I said I feared we were not quite grand enough for him
17,null,null,Carrie said there was  "  no offence in asking him
18,null,null,I said :    "  Certainly not
19,null,null,"   and I wrote him a letter
20,null,null,Carrie confessed she was a little disappointed with Daisy Mutlar 's appearance
21,null,null,but thought she seemed a nice girl .
812 12
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,After Gowing left
2,null,null,Lupin came in
3,null,null,and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar
4,null,null,carped at and criticised the arrangements
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,in fact
7,null,null,disapproved of everything
8,null,null,including our having asked our old friend Cummings
9,null,null,who
10,null,null,he said
11,null,null,would look in evening dress like a green grocer engaged to wait
12,surprise,surprised,and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one .
813 12
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,fter Gowing left
2,null,null,Lupin came in
3,fear,anxiety,and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar
4,null,null,carped at and criticised the arrangements
5,null,null,and
6,null,null,in fact
7,null,null,disapproved of everything
8,null,null,including our having asked our old friend Cummings
9,null,null,who
10,null,null,he said
11,null,null,would look in evening dress like a green grocer engaged to wait
12,null,null,and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one .
814 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,At ten o'clock we went down to supper
2,null,null,and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month
3,null,null,I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr
4,null,null,Perkupp should come by mere chance
5,null,null,Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of champagne
6,null,null,and drinking it straight off
7,null,null,He repeated this action
8,fear,fear,and made me fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out
9,null,null,I tried to keep a bottle back
10,null,null,but Lupin got hold of it
11,null,null,and took it to the side table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar .
815 9
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,When he went
2,null,null,he said
3,surprise,surprise :,to our surprise :    "  I will come to-morrow and bring my Irving make-up
4,null,null,Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and would come too
5,null,null,I could not help thinking they might as well give a party at my house while they are about it
6,null,null,However
7,null,null,as Carrie sensibly said :    "  Do anything
8,null,null,dear
9,null,null,to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar business .  "
816 6
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,Lupin
2,surprise,surprise,to my surprise
3,null,null,said :    "  Oh yes
4,null,null,He showed me the letter before he sent it
5,null,null,I think he is right
6,null,null,and you ought to apologise .  "
817 6
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,She replied
2,surprise,surprise :,to my surprise :    "  I really wasnt listening
3,null,null,dear
4,null,null,I was obliged to leave to give instructions to the laundress
5,null,null,In consequence of some stuff she puts in the water
6,null,null,two more of Lupin 's coloured shirts have run and he says he wont wear them .  "
818 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening
2,null,null,and Cummings never does
3,fear,fear,I fear they dont get on well with Lupin .
819 17
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,January 4
2,null,null,- Mr Perkupp sent for me and told me that my position would be that of one of the senior clerks
3,surprise,overjoyed,I was more than overjoyed
4,null,null,Mr Perkupp added
5,null,null,he would let me know to-morrow what the salary would be
6,null,null,This means another day 's anxiety
7,null,null,I dont mind
8,null,null,for it is anxiety of the right sort
9,null,null,That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the letter I received from Mr Mutlar
10,null,null,senr
11,null,null,I broached the subject to Lupin in the evening
12,null,null,having first consulted Carrie
13,null,null,Lupin was riveted to the FINANCIAL NEWS
14,null,null,as if he had been a born capitalist
15,null,null,and I said :    "  Pardon me a moment
16,null,null,Lupin
17,null,null,how is it you have not been to the mutlars ' any day this week
820 18
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,After our little supper
2,null,null,he said :    "  My dear parents
3,null,null,I have some news
4,fear,fear,which I fear will affect you considerably
5,null,null,"    I felt a qualm come over me
6,null,null,and said nothing
7,null,null,Lupin then said :    "  It may distress you - in fact
8,null,null,im sure it will - but this afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for ever
9,null,null,It may seem absurd
10,null,null,but I was so pleased
11,null,null,I immediately opened a bottle of port
12,null,null,Gowing dropped in just in time
13,null,null,bringing with him a large sheet
14,null,null,with a print of a tailless donkey
15,null,null,which he fastened against the wall
16,null,null,He then produced several separate tails
17,null,null,and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper place
18,null,null,My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to bed .
821 13
 (12, 13),
1,null,null,In the evening Lupin arrived home early
2,null,null,and seemed a little agitated
3,null,null,I said :    "  What 's up
4,null,null,my boy
5,null,null,"    He hesitated a good deal
6,null,null,and then said :    "  You know those Parachikka Chlorates I advised you to invest 20 pounds in
7,null,null,I replied :    "  Yes
8,null,null,they are all right
9,null,null,I trust
10,null,null,"    He replied :    "  Well
11,null,null,no
12,surprise,surprise,To the surprise of everybody
13,null,null,they have utterly collapsed
822 16
 (11, 9),
1,null,null,His bank was the Third National of Philadelphia
2,null,null,located in that center of all Philadelphia and indeed
3,null,null,at that time
4,null,null,of practically all national finance Third Street and its owners conducted a brokerage business as a side line
5,null,null,There was a perfect plague of State banks
6,null,null,great and small
7,null,null,in those days
8,null,null,issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity
9,null,null,and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr Cowperwood 's position
10,null,null,As a result
11,fear,become the soul of caution,he had become the soul of caution
12,null,null,Unfortunately
13,null,null,for him
14,null,null,he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field magnetism and vision
15,null,null,He was not destined to be a great financier
16,null,null,though he was marked out to be a moderately successful one
823 15
 (13, 12),
1,null,null,Thereafter
2,null,null,in the course of time
3,null,null,Frank became a familiar figure in the commission district and on ' change ( the Produce Exchange )
4,null,null,striking balances for his employer
5,null,null,picking up odd lots of things they needed
6,null,null,soliciting new customers
7,null,null,breaking gluts by disposing of odd lots in unexpected quarters
8,null,null,Indeed the Watermans were astonished at his facility in this respect
9,null,null,He had an uncanny faculty for getting appreciative hearings
10,null,null,making friends
11,null,null,being introduced into new realms
12,null,null,New life began to flow through the old channels of the Waterman company
13,happiness,satisfied,Their customers were better satisfied
14,null,null,George was for sending him out into the rural districts to drum up trade
15,null,null,and this was eventually done .
824 33
 (16, 2),
1,null,null,About a year later
2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person
10,null,null,not obstreperously so
11,null,null,but quietly and under the surface
12,null,null,Business was a great urge
13,null,null,He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars

21,null,null,Mrs
22,null,null,Semple cried bitterly

31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house
33,null,null,and was considered a charming and interesting widow .

828 13
 (7, 11),
1,null,null,Meanwhile he called on Mrs
2,null,null,Semple
3,null,null,and the more he called the better he liked her
4,null,null,There was no exchange of brilliant ideas between them
5,null,null,but he had a way of being comforting and social when he wished
6,null,null,He advised her about her business affairs in so intelligent a way that even her relatives approved of it
7,happiness,came to like,She came to like him
8,null,null,because he was so considerate
9,null,null,quiet
10,null,null,reassuring
11,null,null,and so ready to explain over and over until everything was quite plain to her
12,null,null,She could see that he was looking on her affairs quite as if they were his own
13,null,null,trying to make them safe and secure .
829 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars
2,null,null,This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right
3,null,null,and he knew exactly what to do with it
4,fear,panic,A panic had come since Mr Semple had died
5,null,null,which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was
6,null,null,There was really a severe business depression .
830 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Next day I joined Grant once more
2,null,null,and found he had collected a few Sorombo men
3,null,null,hoping to follow after me
4,null,null,I then told him all my mishaps in Sorombo
5,fear,frights,as well as of the  "  blue devil "   frights that had seized all my men
6,null,null,I felt greatly alarmed about the prospects of the expedition
7,null,null,scarcely knowing what I should do
8,null,null,I resolved at last
9,null,null,if everything else failed
10,null,null,to make up a raft at the southern end of the N'yanza
11,null,null,and try to go up to the Nile in that way .
831 11
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,These separations from Grant were most annoying
2,null,null,but they could not be helped
3,null,null,so
4,null,null,when all was settled here
5,null,null,I bade him adieu  both of us saying we would do our best and set out on my journey
6,fear,terrible,thinking what a terrible thing it was I could not prevail on my men to view things as I did
7,null,null,Neither my experience with native chiefs
8,null,null,nor my money and guns
9,null,null,were of any use to me
10,null,null,simply because my men were such incomprehensible fools
11,null,null,though many of them who had travelled before ought to have known better .
832 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When within a few miles of the palace we were ordered to stop and wait for Kachuchu 's return
2,null,null,but no sooner put up in a plaintain grove
3,null,null,where pombe was brewing
4,null,null,and our men were all taking a suck at it
5,null,null,than the worthy arrived to call us on the same instant
6,fear,anxious,as the king was most anxious to see us
7,null,null,The love of good beer of course made our men all too tired to march again
833 18
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,More reports came to us about Suwarora
2,null,null,all of the most inviting nature
3,null,null,but nothing else worth mentioning occurred until we reached the border of Msalala
4,null,null,where an officer of M'yonga 's
5,null,null,who said he was a bigger man than his chief
6,null,null,demanded a tax
7,null,null,which I refused
8,null,null,and the dispute ended in his snatching Nasib 's gun out of his hands
9,null,null,I thought little of this affair myself
10,sadness,regretting,beyond regretting the delay which it might occasion
11,null,null,as M'yonga
12,null,null,I knew
13,null,null,would not permit such usage
14,null,null,if I chose to go round by his palace and make a complaint
15,null,null,Both Bui and Nasib
16,null,null,however
17,null,null,were so greatly alarmed
18,null,null,that before I could say a word they got the gun back again by paying four yards merikani .
834 14
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Lumeresi
2,null,null,on hearing this
3,null,null,first consulted me
4,disgust,displeased,saying his chief was displeased with him
5,null,null,accusing him of being too proud
6,null,null,in having at once two such distinguished guests
7,null,null,and meant by these acts only to humble him
8,null,null,I replied
9,null,null,if that was the case
10,null,null,the sooner he allowed us to go
11,null,null,the better it would be for him
12,null,null,and
13,null,null,reminding him of his original promise to give me assistance on to Usui
14,null,null,said he could do so now with a very good grace .
835 14
 (13, 14),
1,null,null,His badges of office he had tied on his head
2,null,null,the butt of a shell
3,null,null,representing the officer 's badge
4,null,null,being fixed on the forehead
5,null,null,whilst a small sheep 's horn
6,null,null,fixed jauntily over the temple
7,null,null,denoted that he was a magician
8,null,null,Wishing to try my powers in magical arts
9,null,null,as I laughed at his church
10,null,null,he begged me to produce an everlasting spring of water by simply scratching the ground
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,drew short up
13,happiness,delight,to the intense delight of my men
14,null,null,on my promising that I would do so if he made one first .
836 15
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,This night one was shot
2,null,null,without any mistake about it
3,null,null,for the next morning we tracked him by his blood
4,null,null,and afterwards heard he had died of his wound
5,null,null,The Wasui elders
6,null,null,contrary to my expectation
7,null,null,then came and congratulated us on our success
8,happiness,wonderful,They thought us most wonderful men
9,null,null,and possessed of supernatural powers
10,null,null,for the thief in question was a magician
11,null,null,who until now was thought to be invulnerable
12,null,null,Indeed
13,null,null,they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people
14,null,null,but though they had so many more guns than ourselves
15,null,null,they never succeeded in killing one .
837 8
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Nasib then returned to inform us that the king had heard our complaint
2,sadness,sorry,and was sorry for it
3,null,null,but said he could not interfere with the rights of his officers
4,null,null,He did not wish himself to take anything from us
5,null,null,and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted
6,null,null,Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers
7,null,null,and begged us to have patience
8,null,null,for he was then fleecing Masudi at the encamping ground near the palace .
838 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Early in the morning we were on foot again
2,happiness,thankful,only too thankful to have got off so cheaply
3,null,null,Then men were appointed as guides and protectors
4,null,null,to look after us as far as the border
5,null,null,What an honour
6,null,null,We had come into the country drawn there by a combination of pride and avarice and now we were leaving it in hot haste under the guidance of an escort of officers
7,null,null,who were in reality appointed to watch us as dangerous wizards and objects of terror .
839 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Whilst Baraka 's arguments all rested the other way
2,null,null,that no one could tell what was ahead of him Bana had sold himself to luck and the devil but though he did not care for his own safety
3,disgust,fools,he ought not to sacrifice the lives of others Bombay and his lot were fools for their pains in trusting to him .
840 10
 (3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side
2,null,null,when
3,surprise,surprise,to surprise me
4,null,null,the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us
5,null,null,They had gone out of the lake at its northern end
6,null,null,paddled into
7,null,null,and then up the Kagera to where we stood
8,null,null,showing
9,null,null,by actual navigation
10,null,null,the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon .
841 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu ( men eaters )
2,null,null,who disdained all food but human flesh
3,null,null,and Rumanika confirmed the statement
4,disgust,sceptical,Though I felt very sceptical about it
5,null,null,I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick 's Nyam Nyams ( men eaters ) .
842 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,We then went into a discourse on astrology
2,null,null,when the intelligent Rumanika asked me if the same sun we saw one day appeared again
3,null,null,or whether fresh suns came every day
4,null,null,and whether or not the moon made different faces
5,disgust,laugh,to laugh at us mortals on earth .
843 14
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Next day
2,null,null,after crossing more of those abominable rush drains
3,null,null,whilst in sight of the Victoria N'yanza
4,happiness,beautiful,we ascended the most beautiful hills
5,null,null,covered with verdure of all descriptions
6,null,null,At Meruka
7,null,null,where I put up
8,null,null,there resided some grandees
9,null,null,the chief of whom was the king 's aunt
10,null,null,She sent me a goat
11,null,null,a hen
12,null,null,a basket of eggs
13,null,null,and some plantains
14,null,null,in return for which I sent her a wire and some beads .
844 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .
845 13
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,I then ( 16th ) very much wished to go and see the escape of the Mwerango river
2,disgust,sceptical,as I still felt a little sceptical as to its origin
3,null,null,whether or not it came off those smaller lakes I had seen on the road the day before I crossed the river
4,null,null,but no one would listen to my project
5,null,null,They all said I must have the king 's sanction first
6,null,null,else people
7,null,null,from not knowing my object
8,null,null,would accuse me of practising witchcraft
9,null,null,and would tell their king so
10,null,null,They still all maintained that the river did come out of the lake
11,null,null,and said
12,null,null,if I liked to ask the king 's leave to visit the spot
13,null,null,then they would go and show it me .
846 15
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,The day was now gone
2,null,null,so torches were lit
3,null,null,and we were ordered to go
4,null,null,though as yet I had not been able to speak one word I wished to impart about Petherick and Grant
5,fear,afraid,for my interpreters were so afraid of the king they dared not open their mouths until they were spoken to
6,null,null,The king was now rising to go
7,null,null,when
8,null,null,in great fear and anxiety that the day would be lost
9,null,null,I said
10,null,null,in Kisuahili
11,null,null,"  I wish you would send a letter by post to Grant
12,null,null,and also send a boat up the Kitangule
13,null,null,as far as Rumanika 's palace
14,null,null,for him
15,null,null,for he is totally unable to walk .  "
847 13
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The pages dreaded their master 's wrath
2,null,null,departed for a while
3,sadness,sorry,and then sent another lad to tell me he was sorry to hear I felt unwell
4,null,null,but he hoped I would come if only for a minute
5,null,null,bringing my medicines with me
6,null,null,for he himself felt pain
7,null,null,That this second message was a forged one I had no doubt
8,null,null,for the boys had not been long enough gone
9,null,null,still
10,null,null,I packed up my medicines and went
11,null,null,leaving the onus
12,null,null,should any accident happen
13,null,null,upon the mischievous story bearers .
848 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I then sent Bombay to see the queen
2,null,null,to ask after her health
3,null,null,beg for a hut in the palace enclosures
4,null,null,and say I should have gone myself
5,fear,feared,only I feared her gate might be shut
6,null,null,and I cannot go backwards and forwards so far in the sun without a horse or an elephant to ride upon
7,null,null,She begged I would come next morning .
849 16
 (9, 11),
1,null,null,5th
2,null,null,Alarmed at having got involved in something that looked like court intrigues
3,null,null,I called up N'yamgundu
4,null,null,told him all that happened yesterday
5,null,null,both at the two courts and with Maula at home
6,null,null,and begged him to apply to the king for a meeting of five elders
7,null,null,that a proper understanding might be arrived at
8,null,null,but instead of doing as I desired
9,sadness,terrible,he got into a terrible fright
10,null,null,calling Maula
11,null,null,and told me if I pressed the matter in this way men would lose their lives
12,null,null,Meanwhile the cunning blackguard Maula begged for pardon
13,null,null,said I quite misunderstood his meaning
14,null,null,all he had said was that I was very fortunate
15,null,null,being in such favour at court
16,null,null,for the king and queen both equally loved me .
850 19
 (12, 11),
1,null,null,These Wakungu
2,null,null,having only just then returned from plundering Unyoro
3,null,null,had never before seen their king in a chair
4,null,null,or anybody sitting
5,null,null,as I was
6,null,null,by his side
7,null,null,and it being foreign to their notions
8,null,null,as well as
9,null,null,perhaps
10,null,null,unpleasant to their feelings
11,null,null,to find a stranger sitting higher than themselves
12,sadness,complained,they complained against this outrage to custom
13,null,null,and induced the king to order my dethronement
14,null,null,The result was
15,null,null,as my iron stool was objectionable
16,null,null,I stood for a moment to see that I thoroughly understood their meaning
17,null,null,and then showing them my back
18,null,null,walked straightway home to make a grass throne
19,null,null,and dodge them that way .
851 8
 (5, 1),(5, 4),
1,null,null,This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight
2,null,null,for my cows were eaten up
3,null,null,and my men clamouring incessantly for food
4,null,null,and though they might by orders help themselves  "  ku n'yangania "   by seizing from the Waganda
5,sadness,hurt,it hurt my feelings so much to witness this
6,null,null,that I tried from the first to dispense with it
7,null,null,telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing
8,null,null,and now he turned them into a pack of thieves .
852 10

5,null,null,"  Ah
6,null,null,my fine fellow
7,null,null,"   he thought
8,null,null,"  you would sing a different song if you knew that by this time M de Chalusse is probably dead
9,null,null,and that most likely Mademoiselle Marguerite has only her beautiful eyes left her

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Possibly it was because she did not know where Pascal was going
2,fear,strange disquiet ude,Possibly M de Coralth was the cause of her strange disquiet ude
3,null,null,for she utterly disliked the viscount
4,null,null,Her woman 's instinct warned her that there was something unwholesome about this young man 's peculiar handsomeness
5,null,null,and that it was not safe to trust to his professions of friendship .
855 10
 (1, 1),
1,fear,sudden terror,"  I was stupefied and alarmed by the sudden terror which M de Chalusse had displayed and could not control
2,null,null,What could it all mean
3,null,null,What sorrowful recollections
4,null,null,what mysterious apprehensions
5,null,null,had my words aroused in the count 's mind
6,null,null,I could not understand or imagine why he should regard my question as strange or unnatural
7,null,null,On the contrary
8,null,null,I thought it perfectly natural
9,null,null,dictated as it had been by circumstances
10,null,null,and by the count 's own words and manner .
856 9
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Fortunat left the restaurant
2,null,null,almost on the run
3,fear,feared,for he feared that he might be pursued and overtaken by M Casimir

5,null,null,he paused
6,null,null,not so much to take breath
7,null,null,as to collect his scattered wits
8,null,null,and though the weather was cold
9,null,null,he seated himself on a bench to reflect .

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The rest of the interview came to her only dimly
2,null,null,She knew that Uncle Mathew was still upon his feet protesting
3,surprise,surprise,that her aunt 's face was cold and wore a look of distressed surprise as though some one had suddenly been rude to her .

2,null,null,His mood had changed
3,sadness,sullen,he was sullen
4,null,null,His sister always made him feel like a disgraced dog
5,null,null,He shuffled on his feet .
896 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,She chose instinctively her path
2,null,null,through the kitchen garden at the back of the village
3,null,null,down the hill by the village street
4,null,null,over the little bridge that crossed the rocky stream of the Dreot
5,null,null,and up the steep hill that led on to the outskirts of Rothin Moor
6,null,null,The day
7,null,null,although she had no eyes for it
8,surprise,surprise,was one of those sudden impulses of misty warmth that surprise the Glebeshire frosts
9,null,null,The long stretch of the moor was enwrapped by a thin silver network of haze
10,null,null,the warmth of the sun
11,null,null,seen so dimly that it was like a shadow reflected in a mirror
12,null,null,struck to the very heart of the soil .
897 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,disgust,Her first thought as she went forward was disgust at her own weakness
2,null,null,once again she had been betrayed by her feelings
3,null,null,She could remember no single time when they had not betrayed her .
898 9
 (4, 1),(4, 2),(4, 3),
1,null,null,When at last she found herself
2,null,null,a tiny figure
3,null,null,standing upon the vast platform under the high black dome
4,happiness,excited and delighted,the noise and confusion excited and delighted her
5,null,null,She rose to the waves of sound as a swimmer rises in the sea
6,null,null,her heart beat fast
7,null,null,and she was so eagerly engaged in looking about her
8,null,null,in staring at the hurrying people
9,null,null,in locating the shrill screams of the engines
899 8
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  Oh

1,sadness,nervous,Maggie fancied that the three persons were nervous of her aunt
2,null,null,the stout young man was amused perhaps at the general situation
3,null,null,but Mr

906 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,There was no one in the room
2,null,null,she felt
3,null,null,as she lay there
4,null,null,an increasing irritation at her weakness
5,fear,afraid,She was afraid too for her future
6,null,null,Did she faint like this at the earliest opportunity people would allow her no chance of earning her living .
907 6

1,null,null,She stared at her aunt
2,null,null,then at a long mirror that faced her bed
3,null,null,then at the lighted sky
4,happiness,warmly grateful,She felt warmly grateful
5,null,null,eager to show all the world that she would do her best
6,null,null,that she was ready to give herself to this new life with all her soul and strength she could say nothing .
908 13
 (11, 8),(11, 9),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,deep down in her soul
3,null,null,she knew that she wanted success
4,null,null,a magnificent life
5,null,null,a great future
6,null,null,Any more
7,null,null,she expected it
8,null,null,She had force and strength
9,null,null,and she would compel life to give her what she wanted
10,null,null,She laughed at herself in the glass
11,happiness,happy,She was happy
12,null,null,almost triumphant
13,null,null,and for no reason at all .
909 4
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,Fainted right off there in the drawing-room
2,sadness,anxiously,Or her aunts saying anxiously to one another :   "  Well
3,null,null,I didnt know she was as delicate as that
4,null,null,I hope she wont be always ill
910 8
 (2, 4),
1,null,null,She hated sentiment and affectation in any one
2,fear,afraid,She was afraid
3,null,null,too
4,null,null,that Anne bullied Aunt Elizabeth
5,null,null,Maggie was sorry for Aunt Elizabeth but
6,null,null,with all the arrogance of the young
7,null,null,a little despised her
8,null,null,Why did she tremble and start like that
911 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The bird seemed to have come to her
2,null,null,in the friendliest way
3,null,null,to remove some of the chilly passivity of the house
4,fear,fear,Her greatest fear since her arrival had been that this was a house "  in which nothing was ever going to happen
5,null,null,"   and that  "  she would never get out of it .  "
912 12
 (6, 7),(6, 10),(6, 11),
1,null,null,And yet now
2,null,null,as she looked around her
3,null,null,she was not
4,null,null,to her own surprise
5,null,null,disappointed
6,happiness,satisfied,She was even satisfied
7,null,null,the  "  wonder "   was not in the building
8,null,null,Well
9,null,null,then
10,null,null,it must be in something  "  inside "
11,null,null,something that she had yet to discover
12,null,null,The chapel had the thrilling quality of a little plain deal box that carries a jewel .
913 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Aunt Anne walked first and took what was obviously her own regular seat near the front
2,null,null,Maggie sat between her two aunts
3,surprise,surprise,She could not feel for the moment anything but a startled surprise at the ugliness of the building
4,null,null,She had entered at different times the Glebeshire chapels
5,null,null,but their primitive position and need had given them the spirit of honest sincerity .
914 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Amongst that black garbed assembly the blue dress shone out as though it would attract everything to itself
2,null,null,"  She 's very pretty
3,null,null,"   thought Maggie
4,null,null,who was more conscious of her shabby clothes than ever
5,surprise,surprise,But her chief feeling was of surprise that so brilliant a bird had been able to penetrate into the chapel at all
6,null,null,"  She must be a stranger just come out of curiosity .  "
915 6
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  Thou knowest how we are weak and foolish
2,null,null,our faults are all known to Thee and our blunders are not hid
3,happiness,thank,therefore we thank Thee that Thou hast not been impatient with us
4,null,null,but
5,null,null,seeing that we are but little children in Thy hands
6,null,null,hast deemed the thunderbolt too heavy for our heads and the lightning too blinding for our eyes .
916 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But behind the facility and easy flow of his words Maggie fancied that she detected some urgent insistence that came from the man 's very heart
2,happiness,was moved,She was moved by that as though he were saying to her personally
3,null,null,"  dont heed these outward words of mine
4,null,null,But listen to me myself .
917 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  you 've come to live here
2,null,null,have n't you
3,null,null,"   continued Miss Smith
4,happiness,glad,"  im so glad
5,null,null,I think you look so nice
6,null,null,You dont mind my saying that
7,null,null,do you
8,null,null,I always tell people what I think of them and then one knows where one is .
918 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Miss Smith 's further confidences were interrupted by the aunts and behind them
2,null,null,to Maggie 's great surprise
3,null,null,Mr
4,null,null,Warlock and his son
5,sadness,embarrassed,The sudden descent of these gentlemen upon the still lingering echoes of Miss Caroline Smith 's critical and explanatory remarks embarrassed Maggie .

1,null,null,His voice was of an extreme kindliness and his eyes
2,null,null,when she looked up at him
3,null,null,shone with friendliness
4,null,null,She found herself
5,surprise,surprise,to her own surprise
6,null,null,talking to him with great ease
7,null,null,He was perfectly simple
8,null,null,human and unaffected
9,null,null,He asked her about her country .
920 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,He had seen her old hands tremble with suppressed temper on the very day after his arrival
2,anger,anger,he had seen her old lips white with anger because the maid had brought her the wrong shawl
3,null,null,Old ladies must of course have their fancies
4,null,null,but his mother had some fixed and fierce purpose in her life that was quite beyond his powers of penetration .
921 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,How fantastic these theories of fire and passion must seem
2,happiness,amused,he amused himself by considering
3,null,null,to any one who knew his mother only from the outside .
922 6
 (1, 1),
1,fear,fear,Her fear was of Martin
2,null,null,She feared very deeply his influence upon her husband
3,null,null,During Martin 's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it
4,null,null,John Warlock
5,null,null,the master
6,null,null,had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body .

924 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She had seen before in earlier days the force of her husband 's passion when it was roused
2,fear,terrified,There was something now in his reception of their son that terrified her
3,null,null,She had at once perceived that Amy was as deeply moved as she .
925 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Such things could not frighten
2,fear,dismay,of course he was no longer a child and yet because he had once been frightened some impression of alarm and dismay hovered over him .
926 11
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,"  Father
2,sadness,disappointed,youll be badly disappointed in me
3,null,null,i 've been feeling it coming all the time

927 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  I might not have come
2,surprise,surprised,"   Martin said with a sudden anger that surprised himself
3,null,null,"  She made no conditions
4,null,null,I might have gone on with my life there abroad
5,null,null,I am free to lead my own life where and how I please .  "
928 9
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,What did Martin remember
2,null,null,He remembered a good deal
3,surprise,surprised,He was surprised when he began to think
4,null,null,"  Did he remember
5,null,null,his father suggested a scene
6,null,null,a day yes
7,null,null,he remembered that
8,null,null,His father continued
9,null,null,as though it had been for his own pleasure .
929 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He could see Mason Street with its grocer 's shop at the corner
2,null,null,its Baths and Public Library
3,null,null,the sudden little black dips into the areas as the houses followed one another
4,happiness,excited,the lamp-post opposite their window that had always excited him because it leaned inwards a little as though it would presently tumble
5,null,null,He remembered the fat short cook with the pink cotton dress who wheezed and blew so when she had to climb the stairs .
930 4
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,What a little prig and yet how simple it had all been
2,null,null,without any consciousness of insincerity or acting on his part
3,null,null,God had chosen him and there he was
4,happiness,happy,for ever and ever safe and happy .

1,null,null,Then when at last she had mounted the vehicle she would flood the conductor with a stream of little questions

3,sadness,confused,She would be desperately confused when asked to pay for her ticket
4,null,null,would be unable to find her purse
5,null,null,and then when she discovered it would scatter its contents upon the ground
6,null,null,In such an agony would she be at the threatened passing of her destination that she would spring up at every pause of the omnibus
7,null,null,striking her nearest neighbour 's eye or nose with her umbrella
8,null,null,apologising nervously
9,null,null,and then
10,null,null,because she thought she had been too forward with a stranger
11,null,null,staring fiercely about her and daring any one to speak to her .

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Her attitude was one of surprised excitement
2,surprise,amazed,She was amazed by the most ordinary incidents and conversations
3,null,null,She found Maggie 's life quite incredible .
934 12
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,She had been trained in another school from Caroline
2,null,null,she felt from the very first that upon certain questions her lovely friend was inexperienced
3,null,null,foolish and dangerously reckless
4,null,null,On the question of  "  men
5,null,null,"   for instance
6,null,null,Maggie
7,null,null,with clear knowledge of her father and her uncle
8,null,null,refused to follow Caroline 's light and easy excursions
9,sadness,disappointed,Caroline was disappointed
10,null,null,she had a great deal to say on the subject and could speak
11,null,null,she assured Maggie
12,null,null,from a vast variety of experience :   "  Men are all the same .
935 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Maggie soon discovered that Mr
2,happiness,happy,Magnus was very happy to sit in their house even though Aunt Anne was not present
3,null,null,His attitude seemed to be that the atmosphere that she left behind her was enough for him and that he could not
4,null,null,in justice
5,null,null,expect any more .
936 10
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,here 's your question
4,null,null,Miss Cardinal
5,null,null,Why on earth did I go on writing
6,null,null,Simply because I could n't help myself
7,happiness,happiness,Writing was the only thing in the world that gave me happiness
8,null,null,I thought too that there might be people
9,null,null,here and there
10,null,null,unknown to me who cared for what I did .
937 8
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,impatience,I realised that by nine out of every ten men and five out of every ten women the literary page in the paper is turned over with exactly the same impatience with which I turn over the betting columns
2,null,null,Anyway
3,null,null,why not
4,null,null,perfectly right
5,null,null,And then by this time i 'd seen my old books
6,null,null,often enough
7,null,null,lying scattered amongst dusty piles in second hand shops marked
8,null,null,' all this lot 6d . '
938 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The young man was apparently in love with a lady much older than himself
2,null,null,who wore pince-nez
3,surprise,surprise,but it was an arid kind of love in which the young man discovered motives and symptoms with the same dexterous surprise with which he discovered newts and tadpoles in the cellar pond
4,null,null,Maggie bravely attacked Mr
5,null,null,Magnus .
939 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He had an irritating habit of never finishing his sentences
2,null,null,and the people he knew answered him in the same inconclusive fashion
3,anger,annoyed,The pool in the cellar naturally annoyed him
4,null,null,but he did nothing very practical about it
5,null,null,allowed it to remain there
6,null,null,and discussed it with a Professor of Chemistry .
940 7
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,This was beyond Maggie altogether
2,happiness,agreeable,An agreeable thing
3,null,null,however
4,null,null,about Mr
5,null,null,Magnus was that he did not mind when you disliked his work
6,null,null,He seemed to expect that you would not like it
7,null,null,He was certainly a very un conceited man .
941 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I could n't imagine what they were all about
2,null,null,it wasnt the ordinary London congregation
3,null,null,it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite
4,happiness,excitement,there was an air of expectation and even excitement which is most unusual in a London church
5,null,null,Then there was Warlock
6,null,null,Of course one could see at once that he was an extraordinary man
7,null,null,a kind of prophet all on his own
942 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Oh yes
2,null,null,one of them went back
3,null,null,I remember
4,sadness,disappointing,But his actual meeting with his girl was so disappointing in comparison with his long expectation of it in front of the Temple that he took the next boat back to the island
5,null,null,but he never found it again
6,null,null,He travelled everywhere and died
7,null,null,a disappointed man
8,null,null,at sea .  "

1,null,null,What was there then in Maggie that started up in rebellion at this unexpected declaration
2,null,null,She had been sitting there
3,null,null,tranquil
4,happiness,happy,soothed with a happy sense that her new life was developing securely for her in the way that she would have it
5,null,null,Suddenly she was alert
6,null,null,suspicious
7,null,null,hostile .

 (7, 7),
1,null,null,"  Said
2,null,null,"   he repeated
3,null,null,stammering a little
4,null,null,"  Why only

2,fear,afraid,She stood looking at him with her fine steady gaze that had always made him afraid of her
3,null,null,and did so

8,sadness,disappointed,She will be so disappointed
9,null,null,But at least you 've had Maggie to entertain you .  "
948 5

1,happiness,excited,Then as her mind returned back to her uncle she felt with a throb of excited anticipation that perhaps after all this evening was to prove the turning-point of her life
2,null,null,Her little escape into the streets
3,null,null,her posting of the letter
4,null,null,had been followed so immediately by Uncle Mathew 's visit

 (1, 2),
1,fear,frightened,For a moment Maggie was frightened
2,null,null,She was here in a strange hotel in a strange room with a man whom she scarcely knew
3,null,null,Then she looked up into young Warlock 's face and was reassured
4,null,null,She could trust him .

 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Maggie felt as though she could see the firelight through her body
2,null,null,and with that came also the conviction that Aunt Anne knew everything

7,null,null,that it as surely lies there

9,null,null,in front of us as though we saw it with our own eyes

3,null,null,sometimes they seemed to Maggie to have no meaning
4,null,null,once or twice the voice dropped so low that Maggie did not catch the words
5,null,null,but always there was especial urgency behind the carelessness as though every word were being spoken for a listener 's benefit a listener who sat perhaps with pencil and notebook somewhere in the dark behind them .

3,null,null,black
4,null,null,burning eyes had been stuck
5,fear,frightened,But it was none of these things that frightened Maggie
6,null,null,It was the expression somewhere in the mouth
7,null,null,in the eyes
8,null,null,in the pale bony hands

4,null,null,that they could not hold their castle for long .

1,null,null,The Lyric Theatre was their destination

1040 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,As he breathed she breathed too
2,null,null,and it seemed to her that their bodies rose and fell as one body
3,null,null,Without looking directly at him
4,null,null,which would
5,null,null,she knew
6,sadness,embarrass,embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her
7,null,null,she could out of the corner of her eye see the ruddy brown of his cheek and the hard thick curve of his shoulder .
1041 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But as the play continued she must listen
2,happiness,was thrilling to her,It was her very first play and soon it was thrilling to her so that she forgot
3,null,null,for a time
4,null,null,even Martin
5,null,null,Or rather Martin was mingled with it
6,null,null,absorbed in it
7,null,null,part of it
8,null,null,and she was there too sharing with him the very action of the story .
1042 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But meanwhile
2,null,null,of course
3,null,null,she saw a handsome young soldier who was young like herself
4,sadness,bored,and she was naturally bored with the studious gentleman
5,null,null,Maggie shared all the feelings of the Charity girl
6,null,null,Had she been brought up
7,null,null,say by a man like Mr

1043 10
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Tea came
2,null,null,but she could not eat anything . In some strange way that moment in the theatre when he had pressed her hand had altered everything . She recognised in herself a new Maggie
3,happiness,excited,she was excited with a thick burning excitement
4,null,null,she was almost sleepy with the strain of it and her cheeks were hot
5,null,null,but her throat icy cold . When she told him that she wasnt hungry
6,null,null,he said
7,null,null,"  im not either
8,null,null,Then he added
9,null,null,not looking at her
10,null,null,"  That fellow wont be back for an hour .  "
1044 12
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,null,null,She remembered his dark look

4,null,null,this helplessness
5,null,null,If she could be with him
6,null,null,beside him
7,happiness,fear nothing,she would fear nothing
8,null,null,That night
9,null,null,the first faint suspicion of jealousy
10,null,null,of doubt
11,null,null,an agonising dart of pain at the knowledge of what it would mean to her now if he left her
12,null,null,stirred in her breast . This room was stifling

3,null,null,She had been indignant
4,null,null,disapproving
5,null,null,superior
6,null,null,forbidding
7,null,null,but never angry .
1046 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,The mist of anger dimmed the room
2,null,null,it was in the potatoes and the cold dry mutton
3,null,null,especially was it in the hard pallid knobs of cheese
4,null,null,And Aunt Elizabeth
5,fear,frightened,although she was frightened by her sister 's anger on this occasion
6,null,null,shared in it
7,null,null,She pursed her lips at Maggie and moved her fat
8,null,null,podgy hand as though she would like to smack Maggie 's cheeks .

4,null,null,It had been her own fault for trusting that note to her honour
5,null,null,Caroline had no honour
6,null,null,of course
7,null,null,Maggie might have guessed that from the way that she talked about other people .
1050 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,She went up to her bedroom
2,null,null,and when she reached it she realised
3,fear,with a little pang of fright,with a little pang of fright

 (15, 6),(15, 7),(15, 8),(15, 9),(15, 10),

5,null,null,so formidable an atmosphere of terror and tyrannic discipline
6,null,null,Here gathered together were a few women

4,null,null,She longed
5,null,null,even though she might not advise him
6,null,null,to comfort him
7,null,null,She was beginning to realise something of her own power over him and to see
8,null,null,too
9,null,null,the strange mixture of superstition and self reproach and self distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him .

2,null,null,It was excitement
3,null,null,not only because of the dim mysterious events that the evening promised
4,null,null,but also because she was sure that this day would settle the loneliness of herself and Martin .

3,null,null,whether the aunts meant to take her to the service with them
4,null,null,She had supposed that her introduction to the meeting at Miss Avies 's meant that they intended to include her in this too

3,null,null,The colour had drained from his face
4,null,null,leaving it dry and yellow
5,null,null,He had an amazing resemblance to his father
6,null,null,his eyes had exactly the same bewildered expression as though he were lost and yet he seemed quite calm
7,null,null,his only movement was one hand that wandered up and down his waistcoat feeling the buttons one after the other .

1,null,null,He did indeed seem to lead a mysterious life of his own and paid very little attention to Maggie
2,null,null,asking her once whether she did not think The Golden Ass wonderful
3,null,null,and what did she think of Petronius
4,null,null,and when Maggie laughed and said that she was glad to say she never read anything
5,null,null,he left her in an agitated horror
6,null,null,Lady Rachel Seddon was very grand and splendid
7,fear,frightened,and frightened Katherine
8,null,null,She was related to every kind of duke and marquis
9,null,null,and although that fact did not impress Maggie in the least
10,null,null,it did seem to remove Lady Rachel into quite another world .

1,null,null,He was supported in his confidence by his sister Grace
2,null,null,who obviously adored him
3,null,null,She too was  "  outside "   the family
4,happiness,happy,but she seemed to be quite happy telling endless stories of Paul 's courage and cleverness and popularity
5,null,null,She did indeed believe that skeaton on sea
6,null,null,where Paul had his living
7,null,null,was the hub of the universe
8,null,null,and this amused all the Trenchard family very much indeed .
1083 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,They could be warm-hearted
2,null,null,it was wonderful to see the way that they all adored Katherine
3,null,null,and they had many friends for whom they would do anything
4,null,null,but the Rev

6,happiness,glad,and they would be glad when he went away .

6,null,null,about the troubles with the churchwardens
7,null,null,especially one Mr
8,null,null,Bellows
9,null,null,who
10,null,null,in his cantankerous and dyspeptic objections to everything that any one proposed
11,null,null,became quite a lively figure to Maggie 's imagination
12,null,null,about the St .
1085 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Maggie rebuked herself for thinking this
2,null,null,but again and again the thought arose
3,null,null,Grace was in a state of perpetual wonder
4,surprise,amazed,everything amazed her
5,null,null,You would not think to look at her flat broad placidity that she was a creature of excitement
6,null,null,and it might be that her excitement was rather superficial
7,null,null,She would say :   "  Why
8,null,null,Just fancy

1103 5

1,null,null,These things were not for her
2,null,null,and indeed did she allow her fancy to dwell
3,null,null,for a moment
4,fear,a panic,upon them she was besieged at once by so horrid a panic that she lost all control and self possession
5,null,null,She therefore very quickly put those things from her and thenceforth lived in the world as in a castle surrounded by a dark moat filled with horrible and slimy creatures who would raise a head at her did she so much as glance their way .
1104 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The moment she saw Maggie she was resolved
2,null,null,here was just the creature
3,null,null,a mouse of a girl
4,null,null,no parents
5,null,null,no money
6,null,null,no appearance
7,null,null,nothing to make her proud or above herself
8,null,null,some one to be moulded and trained in the way she should go
9,surprise,surprise,To her great surprise she discovered that Paul was at once attracted by Maggie :  had she ever wondered at anything she would have wondered at this
10,null,null,but she decided that it was because she herself had made the suggestion
11,null,null,Dear Paul
12,null,null,he was always so eager to fall in with any of her proposals .

1107 7
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,And that other life began to be dim and faint even Martin was a little hidden and mysterious
2,happiness,glad,Strangely she was glad of that
3,null,null,the only way that this could be carried through was by keeping the other out of it
4,null,null,Would the two worlds mingle
5,null,null,Would the faces and voices of those spirits be seen and heard again
6,null,null,Would they leave Maggie now or plan to steal her back
7,null,null,The whole future of her life depended on the answer to that
1108 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She was bored with them all
2,null,null,the Choir practices
3,null,null,the Committees
4,null,null,the Altar flowers
5,null,null,and the rest
6,happiness,pleased,she was only too pleased that Maggie should do the hard work it was quite fair that she
7,null,null,Grace
8,null,null,should have a rest
9,null,null,At the same time she did not at all want to surrender the power that doing these things had given her .

2,null,null,A few days after her return she decided that she  "  must not let these things go
3,null,null,"   so she told Maggie that she would attend the Committee of Old Women 's Comforts and be responsible for the Choir practice .

 (3, 3),

2,null,null,she had nothing much to say unless to some one in whom she was interested
3,fear,frightened,She was frightened lest something should happen to the tea
4,null,null,and she felt that they were all staring at her and asking themselves why her hair was cut short and why her clothes didnt fit better .

2,null,null,however
3,null,null,in Grace 's defence that she gave Maggie every chance
4,surprise,marvelled,She marvelled at her own patience
5,null,null,For two years after that moment
6,null,null,when she decided that Maggie was  "  queer
7,null,null,"   and that her beloved Paul was in real danger of his losing his soul because of that  "  queerness
8,null,null,"   she held her hand
9,null,null,She was not naturally a patient woman she was not introspective enough to be that and she held no brief for Maggie
10,null,null,Nevertheless for two whole years she held her hand
1115 8
 (5, 3),(5, 4),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,when in the dusk of that summer evening
3,null,null,she saw Paul kiss Maggie
4,null,null,as the moths blundered about her lamp
5,fear,terrified,her stolid unimaginative heart was terrified

1,sadness,despair,It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune
2,null,null,which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country
3,null,null,Moreover
4,null,null,he had once more lost the Princess Badoura 's talisman
5,null,null,which he feared he might never see again
6,null,null,There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done
7,null,null,and to live on in the cottage
8,null,null,As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself
9,null,null,he engaged a lad to help him
10,null,null,and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars
11,null,null,filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport .

1,null,null,She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back
2,null,null,She waited for him till evening rather impatiently
3,null,null,and wondering what could have kept him from her so long
4,surprise,despair,When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly
5,null,null,In spite of her grief and anxiety however
6,null,null,she did not lose her presence of mind
7,null,null,but decided on a courageous
8,null,null,though very unusual step .
1120 9
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  My son
2,fear,fear,the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it
3,null,null,There are no olives in the Ebony Island
4,null,null,and those imported from here fetch a high price
5,null,null,As you know
6,null,null,I have a good stock of the olives which grew in this garden
7,null,null,Now you must take fifty jars
8,null,null,fill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives
9,null,null,We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark .  "
1121 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The prince took this advice
2,null,null,and spent the rest of the day filling the fifty jars
3,fear,fearing,and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip from his arm and be lost again
4,null,null,he took the precaution of putting it in one of the jars
5,null,null,on which he made a mark so as to be able to recognise it
6,null,null,When night came the jars were all ready
7,null,null,and the prince and his host went to bed .

4,happiness,happy,but rather make me happy by giving her to me in marriage
5,null,null,However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly
6,null,null,the sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices
7,null,null,and I will gratefully receive her from your hands .  "

2,null,null,but when she declared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess lost all respect
3,null,null,and answered that if she were not allowed to marry as she wished she should kill herself
4,null,null,and it was in vain that the queen tried to pacify her and bring her to reason .

1,null,null,"  The king
2,null,null,her father
3,null,null,has carefully shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze
4,null,null,and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband
5,null,null,But in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before
6,null,null,The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal
7,null,null,the second of bronze
8,null,null,the third of fine steel
9,null,null,the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze
10,null,null,the fifth of touchstone
11,null,null,the sixth of silver
12,null,null,and the seventh of solid gold
13,null,null,They are all most sumptuously furnished
14,null,null,whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste
15,null,null,In fact
16,null,null,neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess
17,null,null,The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide
18,null,null,and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage
19,null,null,The king has always received these embassies graciously
20,null,null,but says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will
21,null,null,and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal
22,sadness,disappointed,the envoys have had to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were gratified by their magnificent receptions .

3,null,null,this is our land

11,null,null,at dusk
12,null,null,I was working in my shop with a light heart when the little hunchback
13,null,null,who was more than half drunk
14,null,null,came and sat in the doorway
15,null,null,He sang me several songs
16,null,null,and then I invited him to finish the evening at my house
17,null,null,He accepted my invitation
18,null,null,and we went away together
19,null,null,At supper I helped him to a slice of fish
20,null,null,but in eating it a bone stuck in his throat
21,null,null,and in spite of all we could do he died in a few minutes
22,null,null,We felt deeply sorry for his death
23,fear,fearing,but fearing lest we should be held responsible
24,null,null,we carried the corpse to the house of the Jewish doctor
25,null,null,I knocked
26,null,null,and desired the servant to beg her master to come down as fast as possible and see a sick man whom we had brought for him to cure
27,null,null,and in order to hasten his movements I placed a piece of money in her hand as the doctor 's fee
28,null,null,Directly she had disappeared I dragged the body to the top of the stairs
29,null,null,and then hurried away with my wife back to our house
30,null,null,In descending the stairs the doctor accidentally knocked over the corpse
31,null,null,and finding him dead believed that he himself was the murderer
32,null,null,But now you know the truth set him free
33,null,null,and let me die in his stead .  "

15,null,null,Again she will beseech me to listen to her entreaties
16,null,null,throwing herself this time at my feet
17,null,null,but all to no purpose
18,null,null,Then

24,null,null,"   and my wife will take it and offer it to me trembling with tears in her eyes
25,null,null,but I shall look in the other direction
26,null,null,This will cause her to weep still more

2,null,null,I could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether
3,null,null,My love of trading
4,null,null,and the pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange
5,null,null,made me set my affairs in order
6,null,null,and begin my journey through some of the Persian provinces
7,null,null,having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the different places I intended to visit
8,null,null,I took ship at a distant seaport
9,null,null,and for some time all went well
10,null,null,but at last
11,null,null,being caught in a violent hurricane
12,null,null,our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her
13,null,null,and many of our company perished in the waves
14,null,null,with a few others
15,null,null,had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck
16,null,null,for the storm had driven us near an island
17,null,null,and scrambling up beyond the reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted
18,null,null,to wait for morning .

1,null,null,With that he supplied me with provisions
2,null,null,and bade me farewell
3,null,null,and I set out with my new companions
4,null,null,I soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts
5,null,null,but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks
6,null,null,I did not at all understand how we were to do it
7,null,null,The crowns of the cocoa palms were all alive with monkeys
8,null,null,big and little
9,null,null,which skipped from one to the other with surprising agility
10,null,null,seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance
11,null,null,and I was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures
12,null,null,which seemed to me quite harmless
13,null,null,But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily
14,null,null,for the monkeys
15,anger,annoyed,annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin
16,null,null,began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful gestures
17,null,null,so that after very little labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained .
1132 24
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and killed it
2,null,null,and handed me a knife

19,null,null,which always stands open
20,null,null,but do not ask us to tell you what we saw or what befel us there
21,null,null,for that you will learn for yourself
22,null,null,This only we may say
23,null,null,that it cost us each our right eye

6,null,null,produced another piece of money in its place
7,null,null,When she had gone
8,null,null,my master was so pleased that he told all the neighbours what I had done
9,null,null,and made a great deal more of it than there really was .

 (7, 7),
1,null,null,The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not ta accept the explanation offered by Prince Firouz Schah
2,null,null,but she was much disturbed at his intention of departing at once
3,null,null,for she feared that
4,null,null,no sooner had he left her
5,null,null,than the impression she had made on him would fade away
6,null,null,So she made one more effort to keep him
7,fear,anxiety,and after assuring him that she entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father
8,null,null,begged him to give her a day or two more of his company .
1153 33
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,When the dervish saw that the prince 's mind was made up
2,null,null,he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him
3,null,null,and held it out
4,null,null,"  If it must be so
5,null,null,"   he said
6,null,null,with a sigh
7,null,null,"  take this
8,null,null,and when you have mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you
9,null,null,It will roll on till it reaches the foot of a mountain
10,null,null,and when it stops you will stop also
11,fear,fear,You will then throw the bridle on your horse 's neck without any fear of his straying
12,null,null,and will dismount
13,null,null,On each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones
14,null,null,and will hear a multitude of insulting voices
15,null,null,but pay no heed to them
16,null,null,and
17,null,null,above all
18,null,null,beware of ever turning your head
19,null,null,If you do
20,null,null,you will instantly become a black stone like the rest
21,null,null,For those stones are in reality men like yourself
22,null,null,who have been on the same quest
23,null,null,and have failed
24,null,null,as I fear that you may fail also
25,null,null,If you manage to avoid this pitfall
26,null,null,and to reach the top of the mountain
27,null,null,you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage
28,null,null,and you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water
29,null,null,That is all I have to say
30,null,null,You know what you have to do
31,null,null,and what to avoid
32,null,null,but if you are wise you will think of it no more
33,null,null,but return whence you have come .  "
1154 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  Sire
2,null,null,"   replied the bird
3,null,null,before either the princes or the princess could speak
4,surprise,surprised,"  surely your Highness cannot be so surprised at beholding a cucumber stuffed with pearls
5,null,null,when you believed without any difficulty that the Sultana had presented you
6,null,null,instead of children
7,null,null,with a dog
8,null,null,a cat
9,null,null,and a log of wood .  "

3,null,null,- After Church
4,null,null,the Curate came back with us
5,null,null,I sent Carrie in to open front door
6,null,null,which we do not use except on special occasions
7,null,null,She could not get it open
8,null,null,and after all my display
9,null,null,I had to take the Curate ( whose name
10,null,null,by the by
11,null,null,I did not catch
12,null,null,) round the side entrance
13,null,null,He caught his foot in the scraper
14,null,null,and tore the bottom of his trousers
15,disgust,annoying,Most annoying
16,null,null,as Carrie could not well offer to repair them on a Sunday
17,null,null,After dinner
18,null,null,went to sleep
19,null,null,Took a walk round the garden
20,null,null,and discovered a beautiful spot for sowing mustard and cress and radishes
21,null,null,Went to Church again in the evening :   walked back with the Curate
22,null,null,Carrie noticed he had got on the same pair of trousers
23,null,null,only repaired
24,null,null,He wants me to take round the plate
25,null,null,which I think a great compliment .
1156 29
 (21, 20),
1,null,null,April 30
2,null,null,- Perfectly astounded at receiving an invitation for Carrie and myself from the Lord and Lady Mayoress to the Mansion House
3,null,null,to  "  meet the Representatives of Trades and Commerce
4,null,null,My heart beat like that of a schoolboy 's
5,null,null,Carrie and I read the invitation over two or three times
6,null,null,I could scarcely eat my breakfast
7,null,null,I said - and I felt it from the bottom of my heart
8,null,null,-  "  Carrie darling
9,null,null,I was a proud man when I led you down the aisle of the church on our wedding day
10,null,null,that pride will be equalled
11,null,null,if not surpassed
12,null,null,when I lead my dear
13,null,null,pretty wife up to the Lord and Lady Mayoress at the Mansion House
14,null,null,I saw the tears in Carrie 's eyes
15,null,null,and she said :    "  Charlie dear
16,null,null,it is I who have to be proud of you
17,null,null,And I am very
18,null,null,very proud of you
19,null,null,You have called me pretty
20,null,null,and as long as I am pretty in your eyes
21,happiness,happy,I am happy
22,null,null,You
23,null,null,dear old Charlie
24,null,null,are not handsome
25,null,null,but you are GOOD
26,null,null,which is far more noble
27,null,null,I gave her a kiss
28,null,null,and she said :    "  I wonder if there will be any dancing
29,null,null,I have not danced with you for years .  "

3,null,null,- Lupin spent the whole day with the Mutlars
4,null,null,He seemed rather cheerful in the evening
5,happiness,happy,so I said :    "  im glad to see you so happy
6,null,null,Lupin
7,null,null,He answered :    "  Well
8,null,null,Daisy is a splendid girl
9,null,null,but I was obliged to take her old fool of a father down a peg
10,null,null,What with his meanness over his cigars
11,null,null,his stinginess over his drinks
12,null,null,his farthing economy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second
13,null,null,writing to one on half sheets of notepaper
14,null,null,sticking the remnant of the last cake of soap on to the new cake
15,null,null,putting two bricks on each side of the fireplace
16,null,null,and his general ' outside-halfpenny ' business
17,null,null,' I was compelled to let him have a bit of my mind
18,null,null,I said :    "  Lupin
19,null,null,you are not much more than a boy
20,null,null,I hope you wont repent it .  "
1158 4
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Being ambitious to get ahead socially and financially
2,fear,very careful,he was very careful of whom or with whom he talked
3,null,null,He was as much afraid of Agatha 's she had expressing a rabid or unpopular political or social opinion as he was of being seen with an evil character
4,null,null,though he had really no opinion of great political significance to express .
1159 13
 (5, 9),
1,null,null,He believed sincerely that vast fortunes were to be made out of railroads if one only had the capital and that curious thing
2,null,null,a magnetic personality the ability to win the confidence of others
3,null,null,He was sure that Andrew Jackson was all wrong in his opposition to Nicholas Biddle and the United States Bank
4,null,null,one of the great issues of the day
5,fear,worried,and he was worried
6,null,null,as he might well be
7,null,null,by the perfect storm of wildcat money which was floating about and which was constantly coming to his bank discounted
8,null,null,of course
9,null,null,and handed out again to anxious borrowers at a profit
10,null,null,His bank was the Third National of Philadelphia
11,null,null,located in that center of all Philadelphia and indeed
12,null,null,at that time
13,null,null,of practically all national finance Third Street and its owners conducted a brokerage business as a side line .
1160 13
 (9, 11),
1,null,null,There was a perfect plague of State banks
2,null,null,great and small
3,null,null,in those days
4,null,null,issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity
5,null,null,and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr
6,null,null,Cowperwood 's position
7,null,null,As a result
8,null,null,he had become the soul of caution
9,sadness,Unfortunately,Unfortunately
10,null,null,for him
11,null,null,he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field magnetism and vision
12,null,null,He was not destined to be a great financier
13,null,null,though he was marked out to be a moderately successful one
1161 7

 (6, 5),
1,null,null,The Cowperwoods
2,null,null,father and mother
3,null,null,were not so lean and narrow that they could not enter into the natural tendency to be happy and joyous with their children
4,null,null,and so this family
5,null,null,which increased at the rate of a child every two or three years after Frank 's birth until there were four children
6,happiness,interesting,was quite an interesting affair when he was ten and they were ready to move into the New Market Street home
7,null,null,Henry Worthington Cowperwood 's connections were increased as his position grew more responsible
8,null,null,and gradually he was becoming quite a personage .

8,happiness,pleased,pleased at his interest
9,null,null,was glad to explain so that even at this early age from ten to fifteen the boy gained a wide knowledge of the condition of the country financially what a State bank was and what a national one
10,null,null,what brokers did
11,null,null,what stocks were
12,null,null,and why they fluctuated in value .
1165 12
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Later
2,null,null,in connection with the scheme to make Texas a State of the Union
3,null,null,a bill was passed providing a contribution on the part of the United States of five million dollars
4,null,null,to be applied to the extinguishment of this old debt
5,null,null,Grund knew of this
6,null,null,and also of the fact that some of this debt
7,null,null,owing to the peculiar conditions of issue
8,null,null,was to be paid in full
9,null,null,while other portions were to be scaled down
10,fear,frighten off,and there was to be a false or pre-arranged failure to pass the bill at one session in order to frighten off the outsiders who might have heard and begun to buy the old certificates for profit
11,null,null,He acquainted the Third National Bank with this fact
12,null,null,and of course the information came to Cowperwood as teller .
1166 11

6,null,null,I thought when you married old brother Hy here that you were going to fatten up like your brother
7,null,null,But look at you
8,null,null,I swear to Heaven you dont weigh five pounds
9,null,null,And he jounced her up and down by the waist
10,null,null,much to the perturbation of the children
11,null,null,who had never before seen their mother so familiarly handled .

3,null,null,Since Henry had become teller the family had acquired a piano a decided luxury in those days  brought from Europe
4,null,null,and it was intended that Anna Adelaide
5,null,null,when she was old enough
6,null,null,should learn to play
7,null,null,There were a few uncommon ornaments in the room a gas chandelier for one thing
8,null,null,a glass bowl with goldfish in it
9,null,null,some rare and highly polished shells
10,null,null,and a marble Cupid bearing a basket of flowers
11,null,null,It was summer time
12,null,null,the windows were open
13,null,null,and the trees outside
14,null,null,with their widely extended green branches
15,happiness,pleasantly,were pleasantly visible shading the brick sidewalk
16,null,null,Uncle Seneca strolled out into the back yard .
1169 11
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Young Cowperwood 's mind was working
2,null,null,He had no money with him
3,null,null,but his father was teller of the Third National Bank
4,null,null,and he could quote him as reference
5,null,null,He could sell all of his soap to the family grocer
6,null,null,surely
7,null,null,or
8,null,null,if not
9,null,null,to other grocers

2,null,null,Therefore
3,null,null,he was not surprised
4,null,null,and knew exactly what it meant
5,null,null,when a few days later he was introduced to City Treasurer Julian Bode

7,null,null,"  Of course
8,null,null,you know

2,null,null,and that money in their estimation was supposed to make up for any deficiency in any other respect
3,null,null,"  Butler himself is a very presentable man

11,null,null,oh
12,null,null,what was the use of complaining
13,null,null,They would never get anywhere with her father and mother in charge
14,null,null,She would just have to wait
15,null,null,Marriage was the answer the right marriage
16,null,null,But whom was she to marry
1255 12
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,It was curious
2,null,null,though
3,null,null,that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all their attention and fixed their minds on her so-called idiosyncrasies
4,null,null,All they said was in its peculiar way true
5,null,null,but in addition the girl was really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force
6,null,null,She was running deep with ambition
7,null,null,and she was all the more conspicuous
8,anger,irritating,and in a way irritating to some
9,null,null,because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects
10,null,null,against which she was inwardly fighting
11,null,null,She resented the fact that people could justly consider her parents ineligible
12,null,null,and for that reason her also .

6,null,null,Cowperwood
7,fear,nervous,a little bit nervous because of others .
1259 6
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Aileen had swept on to Cowperwood and his mother
2,null,null,who was near him
3,null,null,She had removed from her arm the black satin ribbon which held her train and kicked the skirts loose and free
4,null,null,Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur
5,happiness,spirited,like a spirited collie 's
6,null,null,and her even teeth showed beautifully .
1260 11
 (5, 4),(6, 4),
1,null,null,He did not know why he said this
2,null,null,He was not especially poetic
3,null,null,He had not formulated the phrase beforehand
4,null,null,Since his first glimpse of her in the hall
5,happiness,spirited,his feelings and ideas had been leaping and plunging like spirited horses
6,happiness,set his teeth and narrow his eyes,This girl made him set his teeth and narrow his eyes
7,null,null,Involuntarily he squared his jaw
8,null,null,looking more defiant
9,null,null,forceful
10,null,null,efficient
11,null,null,as she drew near
1261 28
 (25, 22),
1,null,null,She had stood before her mirror between eight and nine it was nine fifteen before she was really ready and pondered over what she should wear
2,null,null,There were two tall pier glasses in her wardrobe  an unduly large piece of furniture and one in her closet door
3,null,null,She stood before the latter
4,null,null,looking at her bare arms and shoulders
5,null,null,her shapely figure
6,null,null,thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple
7,null,null,and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles
8,null,null,The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first
9,null,null,and she chided her maid
10,null,null,Kathleen Kelly
11,null,null,She studied how to arrange her hair
12,null,null,and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted
13,null,null,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,null,null,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,null,null,Finally
16,null,null,she found one size and one place that suited her
17,null,null,She turned her head from side to side
18,null,null,looking at the combined effect of her hair
19,null,null,her penciled brows
20,null,null,her dimpled shoulder
21,null,null,and the black beauty spot
22,null,null,If some one man could see her as she was now
23,null,null,some time
24,null,null,Which man
25,fear,frightened,That thought scurried back like a frightened rat into its hole
26,null,null,She was
27,null,null,for all her strength
28,null,null,afraid of the thought of the one the very deadly the man .

1263 10
 (3, 5),
1,null,null,And then she came to the matter of a train gown
2,null,null,Kathleen laid out five
3,happiness,honor,for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently
4,null,null,and she had
5,null,null,with the permission of her mother and father
6,null,null,indulged herself to the full
7,null,null,She studied a golden-yellow silk
8,null,null,with cream lace shoulder straps
9,null,null,and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully
10,null,null,but set it aside .
1264 14
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsoned silver sequins
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,lo
4,null,null,it touched her
5,null,null,She liked its coquettish drapery of tulle and silver about the hips
6,null,null,The  "  overskirt
7,null,null,"   which was at that time just coming into fashion
8,null,null,though avoided by the more conservative
9,null,null,had been adopted by Aileen with enthusiasm
10,happiness,thrilled,She thrilled a little at the rustle of this black dress
11,null,null,and thrust her chin and nose forward to make it set right
12,null,null,Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little more
13,null,null,she gathered the train over her arm by its train band and looked again
14,null,null,Something was wanting .
1265 15
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,While he was dancing first with Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood and later with Mrs
3,null,null,Seneca Davis
4,null,null,and still later with Mrs
5,null,null,Martyn Walker
6,null,null,Cowperwood had occasion to look at Aileen often
7,happiness,a sense of great vigor,and each time that he did so there swept over him a sense of great vigor there
8,null,null,of beautiful if raw
9,null,null,dynamic energy that to him was irresistible and especially so to-night
10,null,null,She was so young
11,null,null,She was beautiful
12,null,null,this girl
13,null,null,and in spite of his wife 's repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his clear
14,null,null,aggressive
15,null,null,unblinking attitude than any one whom he had yet seen in the form of woman .

5,null,null,His personality was obviously so dominating
6,null,null,Now that he was so close to her

1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,I just wanted to see how you danced
3,null,null,"   she said
4,null,null,tamely
5,null,null,the force of her original feeling having been weakened by a thought of what she was doing
6,happiness,smiled,He noted the change and smiled

1271 15
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Cowperwood understood
2,null,null,He walked away
3,fear,nervous,He was quite warm and tense now almost nervous
4,null,null,It was quite clear to him that he had done or was contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing
5,null,null,Under the current code of society he had no right to do it
6,null,null,It was against the rules
7,null,null,as they were understood by everybody
8,null,null,Her father
9,null,null,for instance his father every one in this particular walk of life
10,null,null,However
11,null,null,much breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be
12,null,null,the rules were still there
13,null,null,As he had heard one young man remark once at school
14,null,null,when some story had been told of a boy leading a girl astray and to a disastrous end
15,null,null,"  That is n't the way at all .  "
1272 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Still
2,null,null,now that he had said this
3,null,null,strong thoughts of her were in his mind
4,null,null,And despite his involved social and financial position
5,null,null,which he now recalled
6,happiness,interesting,it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even calculatingly and worse
7,null,null,enthusiastically  he was pumping the bellows that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl
8,null,null,to feed a fire that might ultimately consume him and how deliberately and resourcefully
1273 6

1,null,null,"  Fine
2,null,null,let me tell you
3,null,null,I stepped on a lady 's dress over there

6,null,null,She gave me such a look .  "

2,null,null,its beauty and subtlety
3,null,null,to his material disadvantage
4,happiness,happy,he found a happy mean
5,null,null,owing to the swiftness of his intellectual operations
6,null,null,whereby he could
7,null,null,intellectually and emotionally
8,null,null,rejoice in the beauty of life without interfering with his perpetual material and financial calculations
9,null,null,And when it came to women and morals
10,null,null,which involved so much relating to beauty
11,null,null,happiness
12,null,null,a sense of distinction and variety in living
13,null,null,he was but now beginning to suspect for himself at least that apart from maintaining organized society in its present form there was no basis for this one life
14,null,null,one love idea .

10,null,null,by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,agony,And so hath been constrained in agony To bite with fierce teeth through the prisoned limb Ere it could win back to its cave
2,null,null,and there In hunger and torturing pains it languisheth .
1633 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Hearkening he sat To Odysseus and to godlike Diomede
2,anger,wrath,And all the hoarded wrath for olden wrongs And all the torturing rage
3,null,null,melted away .
1634 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Then all their mightiest men gave ear to him Save twain
2,null,null,fierce hearted Neoptolemus And Philoctetes mighty souled
3,null,null,for these Still were insatiate for the bitter fray
4,happiness,longed,Still longed for turmoil of the fight
5,null,null,ey bade Their own folk bear against that giant wall What things whatsoever for war 's assaults avail
6,null,null,In hope to lay that stately fortress low
7,null,null,Seeing Heaven 's decrees had brought them both to war .
1635 2
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,thrilled,And all their souls were thrilled with lust of war :  There gathered too the Lords of the wide Sea . These in their wrath were eager to destroy The Horse of Guile and all the ships

1638 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then did the Goddess strike him utterly blind
2,null,null,Stared his fixed eyeballs white from pits of blood
3,sadness,groaned,And all folk groaned for pity of their friend
4,null,null,And dread of the prey giver
5,null,null,lest he had sinned In folly against her
6,null,null,and his mind was thus Warped to destruction yea .
1639 4

2,null,null,un scalable
3,fear,fearful,wherein Dwelt fearful monsters of the deadly brood Of Typhon

3,null,null,and the flames Died out
4,null,null,as though ' neath heavy hissing rain .
1642 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,But straightway from her hands they plucked and flung Afar the fire and steel
2,null,null,and careless turned To the feast
3,null,null,for darkened over them their last night
4,happiness,joyed,Within the horse the Argives joyed to hear The uproar of Troy 's feasters setting at naught Cassandra

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,All his heaviness of cheer And misery vanished by the immortals ' will
2,happiness,glad,And glad at heart were all that looked on him
3,null,null,And from affliction he awoke to joy
4,null,null,Over the bloodless face the flush of health Glowed
5,null,null,and for wretched weakness mighty strength Thrilled through him :  goodly and great waxed all his limbs .
1645 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Man after man he slew like some fierce beast
2,fear,shrank,And foes shrank from the terrible rage that burned On his life 's verge

6,null,null,Had not his hands grown weary
7,null,null,his spear head Bent utterly .
1646 3

1,null,null,Into Oenone 's presence thus he came
2,surprise,Amazed,Amazed her thronging handmaids looked on him As at the Nymph 's feet that pale suppliant fell Faint with the anguish of his wound
3,null,null,whose pangs Stabbed him through brain and heart .
1647 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Then in exceeding feebleness he spake :   "  O reverenced wife
2,anger,hate,turn not from me in hate For that I left thee widowed long ago
3,null,null,Not of my will I did it :  the strong Fates Dragged me to Helen   oh that I had died Ere I embraced her   in thine arms had died
1648 4

1,null,null,This should offend The Prayers
2,null,null,the Daughters of the Thunderer Zeus

2,null,null,while they talked
3,null,null,gave up the ghost On Ida :  never Helen saw him more
4,sadness,Loud wailed,Loud wailed the Nymphs around him
5,null,null,for they still Remembered how their nursling wont to lisp His childish prattle
6,null,null,compassed with their smiles .
1651 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,cried,And cried to her heart with miserable moans :   "  Woe for my wickedness
2,null,null,O hateful life
3,null,null,I loved mine hapless husband   dreamed with him To pace to eld 's bright threshold hand in hand
4,null,null,And heart in heart
1652 5
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,mourned,Troy 's daughters mourned within her walls
2,null,null,might none Go forth to paris ' tomb
3,null,null,for far away From high built Troy it lay
4,null,null,But the young men Without the city toiled unceasingly In fight wherein from slaughter rest was none
5,null,null,Though dead was Paris .
1653 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Far from his brawny hand Euryalus hurled A massy stone
2,null,null,and shook the ranks of Troy
3,anger,anger,As when in anger against long screaming cranes A watcher of the field leaps from the ground
4,null,null,In swift hand whirling round his head the sling
5,null,null,And speeds the stone against them
6,null,null,scattering Before its hum their ranks far down the wind Outspread .
1654 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Suddenly spake the God to these In Polymestor 's shape

9,null,null,for Fate Hath spun long destiny threads for thee and thee .  "
1655 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,He spake
2,null,null,and vanished
3,null,null,mingling with the winds
4,null,null,But their hearts felt the God 's power :  suddenly Flooded with boundless courage were their frames
5,anger,Maddened,Maddened their spirits :  on the foe they leapt Like furious wasps that in a storm of rage Swoop upon bees
6,null,null,beholding them draw nigh In latter summer to the mellowing grapes
7,null,null,Or from their hives forth streaming thitherward .

 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But not very heartily
2,fear,feared,for I feared that his doing of it was only to ease himself of the salary which he gives me
3,null,null,Moore and I went to the French Ordinary
4,null,null,where Mr
5,null,null,Downing this day feasted Sir Arth .
1659 6
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Then came he in
2,null,null,and took a very civil leave of me
3,surprise,beyond my expectations,beyond my expectations
4,null,null,for I was afraid that he would have told me something of removing me from my office
5,null,null,but he did not
6,null,null,but that he would do me any service that lay in his power .
1660 9
 (5, 5),

4,null,null,could I but rate My grief and thy too rigid fate
5,sadness,weep,i 'd weep the world to such a strain That it should deluge once again
6,null,null,But since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies More from briareus ' hands
7,null,null,than argus ' eyes

9,null,null,And write thy epitaph with blood and wounds .
1661 7
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,ashamed,And how that he is quite ashamed of himself
2,null,null,and confesses how he had deserved this
3,null,null,for his baseness to his brother
4,null,null,And that he is like to pay part of the money
5,null,null,paid out of the Exchequer during the Committee of Safety
6,null,null,out of his own purse again
7,null,null,which I am glad on .
1662 4
 (4, 4),

5,fear,fears,that he fears the Cavaliers in the House will be so high
6,null,null,that the other will be forced to leave the House and fall in with General Monk
7,null,null,and so offer things to the King so high on the Presbyterian account that he may refuse

 (1, 1),
1,surprise,very strange,Which story is very strange that he should lose his reputation of being a man of courage now at one blow for that he was not able to fight one stroke

5,null,null,is in none of the best condition We had also certain news to-day that the Spaniard is before Lisbone with thirteen sayle .

1,null,null,By water to White Hall
2,null,null,and there waited upon my Lord Sandwich
3,happiness,joyed,and joyed him
4,null,null,at his lodgings
5,null,null,of his safe coming home after all his danger
6,null,null,which he confesses to be very great .
1701 3
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The spoilers see and quake
2,null,null,no more think they Of feasting
3,fear,panic,but they turn in panic flight Huddling :  fast follow at their heels the hounds Biting remorselessly .
1702 4
 (2, 4),(3, 4),
1,null,null,While long and loud Squealing they flee
2,happiness,joys,and joys the harvest 's lord
3,happiness,rejoiced,So rejoiced Phoebus
4,null,null,seeing from the war Fleeing the mighty Argive host .
1703 3
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,No more Cared they for deeds of men
2,sadness,cried,but cried to the Gods For swift feet
3,null,null,in whose feet alone was hope To escape eurymachus ' and aeneas ' spears Which lightened ever all along their rear .
1704 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Scared were the Argives
2,fear,startled,like a startled team Of oxen ' neath the yoke band straining hard
3,null,null,What time the sharp fanged gadfly stings their flanks Athirst for blood .
1705 4
 (1, 1),
1,anger,frenzy,They are in frenzy of pain Start from the furrow
2,null,null,and sore disquieted The hind is for marred work
3,null,null,and for their sake
4,null,null,Lest perhaps the recoiling ploughshare light On their leg sinews .
1706 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Then Aphrodite
2,sadness,lamented,who lamented sore For Paris slain
3,null,null,snatched suddenly away Renowned Aeneas from the deadly strife
4,null,null,And poured thick mist about him .
1707 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Fate forbade That hero any longer to contend With Argive foes without the high built wall
2,null,null,Yea
3,fear,feared,and his mother sorely feared the wrath Of Pallas passing wise
4,null,null,whose heart was keen To help the Danaans now  .
1708 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,feared,He feared lest she Might slay him even beyond his doom
2,null,null,who spared Not ares ' self
3,null,null,a mightier far than he .
1709 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,No more the Trojans now abode the edge Of fight
2,null,null,but all disheartened backward drew
3,null,null,For like fierce ravening beasts the Argive men Leapt on them
4,anger,mad,mad with murderous rage of war .
1710 6
 (1, 1),
1,anger,Choked,Choked with their slain the river channels were
2,null,null,Heaped was the field
3,null,null,in red dust thousands fell
4,null,null,Horses and men
5,null,null,and chariots overturned Were strewn there :  blood was streaming all around Like rain
6,null,null,for deadly Doom raged through the fray .
1711 5
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,moaned,Here wives and daughters moaned round men come back From war
2,null,null,there cried on many who came not Here
3,null,null,men stung to the soul by bitter pangs Groaned upon beds of pain
4,null,null,there
5,null,null,toil spent men Turned them to supper .

1,anger,wrath,And winged the flight Of what bare down to the Argives doom or dread He fought as when Olympian Zeus himself From heaven in wrath smote down the insolent bands Of giants grim
2,null,null,and shook the boundless earth .
1713 4
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,Groaned,The Locrian men Groaned
2,null,null,seeing their champion quelled by evil doom
3,null,null,For all his hair and all the stones around Were brain be spattered :  all his bones were crushed
4,null,null,And his once active limbs besprent with gore .
1714 8
 (3, 7),
1,null,null,So nerveless flung he fell
2,null,null,And fled away from him the precious life
3,anger,Wroth,Wroth for his friend
4,null,null,a stone Aeneas hurled
5,null,null,And philoctetes ' stalwart comrade slew
6,null,null,Toxaechmes
7,null,null,for he shattered his head and crushed Helmet and skull bones
8,null,null,and his noble heart Was stilled .
1715 12
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Achaea 's lords of might
2,null,null,exceeding fain Safe to win home
3,null,null,made this their offering For safe return
4,anger,wrath,an image to appease The wrath of Pallas for her image stolen From Troy
5,null,null,And to this story shall he stand
6,null,null,How long whatsoever they question him
7,null,null,until
8,null,null,Though never so relentless
9,null,null,they believe
10,null,null,And drag it
11,null,null,their own doom
12,null,null,within the town .
1716 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,For these Still were insatiate for the bitter fray
2,happiness,longed,Still longed for turmoil of the fight
3,null,null,They bade Their own folk bear against that giant wall What things whatsoever for war 's assaults avail
4,null,null,In hope to lay that stately fortress low .
1717 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,As when a wolf
2,null,null,With hunger stung to the heart
3,null,null,comes from the hills
4,happiness,ravenous,And ravenous for flesh draws nigh the flock Penned in the wide fold
5,null,null,slinking past the men And dogs that watch
6,null,null,all keen to ward the sheep .
1718 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,So without sound of voices marched they on Unto the trojans ' fortress
2,happiness,eager,eager all To help those mighty chiefs with foes begirt .
1719 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Some Whose waists the lance had pierced
2,null,null,impaling them Where sharpest stings the anguish laden steel . And all about the city dolorous howls Of dogs up rose
3,sadness,miserable,and miserable moans Of strong men stricken to death
4,null,null,and every home With awful cries was echoing Rang the shrieks Of women .
1720 9
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,I had hardly done reckoning them up when two or three bustling men came out and shepherded us all energetically into a long
2,null,null,low room
3,null,null,where some form of agreement was read out to us
4,null,null,Sailors are naturally and usually careless about the nature of the  "  articles "   they sign
5,fear,anxiety,their chief anxiety being to get to sea
6,null,null,and under somebody 's charge
7,null,null,But had I been ever so anxious to know what I was going to sign this time
8,null,null,I could not
9,null,null,for the language might as well have been Chinese for all I understood of it .
1721 14
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,Sailors are naturally and usually careless about the nature of the  "  articles "   they sign
2,null,null,their chief anxiety being to get to sea
3,null,null,and under somebody 's charge
4,fear,anxious,But had I been ever so anxious to know what I was going to sign this time
5,null,null,I could not
6,null,null,for the language might as well have been Chinese for all I understood of it
7,null,null,wever
8,null,null,I signed and passed on
9,null,null,engaged to go I knew not where
10,null,null,in some ship I did not know even the name of
11,null,null,in which I was to receive I did not know how much
12,null,null,or how little
13,null,null,for my labour
14,null,null,nor how long I was going to be away .
1722 10
 (8, 5),(8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,As night fell
2,null,null,the condition of the  "  greenies
3,null,null,"   or non sailor portion of the crew
4,null,null,was pitiable
5,null,null,Helpless from sea sickness
6,null,null,not knowing where to go or what to do
7,null,null,bullied relentlessly by the ruthless petty officers well
8,sadness,sorry,I never felt so sorry for a lot of men in my life
9,null,null,Glad enough I was to get below into the folk ' sle for supper
10,null,null,and a brief rest and respite from that cruelty on deck .
1723 9
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,For the first quarter of an hour
2,null,null,in spite of the September chill
3,null,null,the sweat poured off me in streams
4,null,null,And the course well
5,null,null,if was not steering
6,null,null,it was sculling
7,null,null,the old bumboat was wobbling all around like a drunken tailor with two left legs
8,sadness,apprehension,I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass
9,null,null,I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way .
1724 6
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Such brutality I never witnessed before
2,null,null,On board of English ships ( except men-of-war ) there is practically no discipline
3,disgust,bad,which is bad
4,null,null,but this sort of thing was maddening
5,null,null,knew how desperately ill all those poor wretches were
6,null,null,how helpless and awkward they would be if quite hale and hearty .
1725 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The third mate was nothing much but bad temper not much sailor
2,null,null,nor much whaler
3,null,null,generally in hot water with the skipper
4,disgust,hated,who hated him because he was an  "  owner 's man
5,null,null,"  An de fourf mate
6,null,null,"   wound up the narrator
7,null,null,straightening his huge bulk
8,null,null,"  am de best man in de ship
9,null,null,and de biggest .
1726 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,It was a splendid picture
2,happiness,glad,but for the time I felt glad I was not on board of her
3,null,null,a very few minutes she was out of our ken
4,null,null,followed by the admiration of all .
1727 10
 (5, 6),(5, 7),(5, 8),
1,null,null,We were all gathered about the folk ' sle scuttle one evening
2,null,null,a few days after the gale referred to in the previous chapter
3,null,null,and the question of whale fishing came up for discussion
4,null,null,Until that time
5,surprise,strange,strange as it may seem
6,null,null,no word of this
7,null,null,the central idea of all our minds
8,null,null,had been mooted
9,null,null,ery man seemed to shun the subject
10,null,null,although we were in daily expectation of being called upon to take an active part in whale fighting .
1728 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,So we toiled watch and watch
2,null,null,six hours on and six off
3,null,null,the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty
4,null,null,and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great
5,null,null,there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil
6,null,null,Some of these were of enormous size
7,null,null,containing 350 gallons when full
8,fear,terrible,and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk .
1729 9
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,However
2,sadness,painfully,the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident
3,null,null,for we had a visit from the afterguard in force one afternoon
4,null,null,and Abner with his brewage was haled to the quarter deck
5,null,null,There
6,null,null,in the presence of all hands
7,null,null,he was arraigned
8,null,null,found guilty of stealing the ship 's stores
9,null,null,and sentence passed upon him .
1730 12
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,Suddenly one of the men
2,null,null,in lifting his net
3,null,null,slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat
4,null,null,jolting one of the oars
5,null,null,There was a gleam of light below as the school turned they had all disappeared instantly
6,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
7,null,null,but now
8,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
9,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
10,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
11,null,null,having been absent only two hours
12,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1731 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
2,null,null,having been absent only two hours
3,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals
4,null,null,Not one of the crew had ever seen or heard of such fishing before
5,happiness,pride,so my pride and pleasure may he imagined
6,null,null,A little learning may be a dangerous thing at times
7,null,null,but it certainly is often handy to have about you .
1732 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1733 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There were men in that forecastle as good citizens and as brave fellows as you would wish to meet men who in their own sphere would have commanded and obtained respect
2,sadness,painful,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
3,null,null,Half starved and hopeless
4,null,null,their spirit had been so broken
5,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
6,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
7,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves .
1734 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle
8,surprise,surprised,which they had surprised during his morning 's nap
9,null,null,e of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat 's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,diving deep
12,null,null,came up underneath him .
1735 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Down comes the black watcher from above with a swoop like an eagle
2,null,null,Booby puts all she knows into her flight
3,null,null,but vainly
4,null,null,Escape is impossible
5,sadness,despairing,so with a despairing shriek she drops her load .
1736 5
 (1, 3),
1,happiness,happy,When we got on board we felt quite happy
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,for the first time since leaving America
4,null,null,we had a little singing
5,null,null,all I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey 's hymns
1737 6
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,but as we secured five of them
2,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
3,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
4,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
5,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
6,null,null,they were so lively .
1738 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,null,null,t as for danger well
3,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
4,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1739 7
 (2, 2),(2, 3),
1,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done
2,sadness,pity,It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo
3,null,null,and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee
4,null,null,Next day
5,null,null,and for a whole week after
6,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
7,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner .  "
1740 1
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,astounding,For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding .
1741 11
 (6, 6),(6, 7),
1,null,null,Like some gigantic beacon
2,null,null,the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene
3,null,null,ulo Way
4,null,null,or Water Island
5,null,null,looked very inviting
6,happiness,glad,and I should have been glad to visit a place so well known to seamen by sight
7,null,null,but so little known by actual touching at
8,null,null,Our recent stay at the Cocos
9,null,null,however
10,null,null,had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative
11,null,null,unless we might be compelled by accident
1742 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Thinking that such a sight ought not to be missed by the captain
2,null,null,I overcame my dread of him sufficiently to call him
3,null,null,and tell him of what was taking place
4,anger,anger,He met my remarks with such a furious burst of anger at my daring to disturb him for such a cause
5,null,null,that I fled precipitately on deck again
6,null,null,having the remainder of the vision to myself
7,null,null,for none of the others cared sufficiently for such things to lose five minutes sleep in witnessing them
8,null,null,The conflict ceased
9,null,null,the sea resumed its placid calm
10,null,null,and nothing remained to tell of the fight but a strong odour of fish
11,null,null,as of a bank of seaweed left by the tide in the blazing sun .
1743 8
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,the three hundred fathoms of line
2,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
3,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
4,happiness,Happily,Happily
5,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
6,null,null,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
7,null,null,Meanwhile
8,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1744 8
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable
2,null,null,the work
3,null,null,with all its dis agreeable s
4,null,null,seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling
5,sadness,poor,Alas for poor Jemmy
6,null,null,as we always persisted in calling him from inability to pronounce his proper name his case was evidently hopeless
7,null,null,His fellows did their poor best to comfort his fast fleeting hours
8,null,null,one after another murmuring to him the prayers of the Church .
1745 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,null,null,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,fear,feared,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant
6,null,null,Besides
7,null,null,it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship
8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1746 12
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,The chief was looking astern at some finbacks
2,null,null,the look-out men forward were both staring to leeward
3,null,null,thus for a minute or so I had a small arc of the horizon to myself
4,null,null,The time was short
5,null,null,but it sufficed
6,null,null,and for the first time that voyage I had the privilege of  "  raising "   a sperm whale
7,happiness,excitement,My voice quivered with excitement as I uttered the war whoop
8,null,null,"  Ah blo o o o w
9,null,null,"   Round spun the mate on his heel
10,null,null,while the hands clustered like bees roused from their hive
11,null,null,"  Where away where
12,null,null,"   gasped the mate .
1747 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,The ship kept near
2,null,null,and Mr
3,null,null,Count
4,null,null,seeing how matters were going
5,null,null,had hastily patched his boat
6,null,null,returning at once with another tub of line
7,null,null,He was but just in time to bend on
8,happiness,delight,when to our great delight we saw the end slip from our rival 's boat
9,null,null,This in no wise terminated his lien on the whale
10,null,null,supposing he could prove that he struck first
11,null,null,but it got him out of the way for the time .
1748 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,annoyed,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders
7,null,null,Great was our delight at the news .
1749 15
 (9, 8),
1,null,null,You WANT somethin' to growl about
2,null,null,you do
3,null,null,"   Well
4,null,null,Cap'n George
5,null,null,"   said one of the men
6,null,null,"  you shorely dont think we k'n eat shells
7,null,null,do yer
8,null,null,"   Just then I caught sight of the kid 's contents
9,anger,indignation,and could hardly restrain my indignation
10,null,null,For in a dirty heap
11,null,null,the sight of which might have pleased an Esquimaux
12,null,null,but was certainly enough to disgust any civilized man
13,null,null,lay the calipee
14,null,null,or under shell of the turtle
15,null,null,hacked into irregular blocks .
1750 9
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,But he gradually returned to his old self
2,happiness,relief,to my great relief
3,null,null,and I ventured somewhat timidly to remind him of the esteem in which he was held by all hands
4,null,null,even the skipper
5,null,null,I ventured to say
6,null,null,respected him
7,null,null,although
8,null,null,from some detestable form of ill humour
9,null,null,he had chosen to be so sneering and insulting towards him .
1751 7
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,As far as I could judge
2,happiness,happiest,they were the happiest of people
3,null,null,literally taking no thought for the morrow and content with the barest necessaries of life
4,null,null,so long as they were free and the sun shone brightly
5,null,null,We had many opportunities of cultivating their acquaintance
6,null,null,for the captain allowed us much liberty
7,null,null,quite one half of the crew and officers being ashore most of the time .
1752 10
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,however
2,null,null,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
3,null,null,where good order was now kept
4,null,null,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
5,happiness,glad,which I was glad to see
6,null,null,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago
7,null,null,Being short-handed
8,null,null,the captain engaged a number of friendly islanders for a limited period
9,null,null,on the understanding that they were to be discharged at their native place
10,null,null,Vau Vau .
1753 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I felt sure
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
4,null,null,In fact
5,fear,afraid,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
6,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
7,null,null,We hauled steadily away
8,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
9,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1754 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
2,null,null,for never a spout did we see
3,happiness,delight,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
4,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time
5,null,null,Determined to have a big catch
6,null,null,if possible
7,null,null,we lowered all five boats
8,null,null,as it was a beautifully calm day
9,null,null,and the ship might almost safely have been left to look after herself .
1755 8
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,But then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related
7,null,null,When the highly dangerous nature of the work is remembered
8,null,null,this statement may seem somewhat overdrawn
1756 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed downward with such terrific force that
2,null,null,striking his head on the bottom
3,null,null,he had broken his neck
4,sadness,grieved,I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance of securing him
5,null,null,but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him
6,null,null,all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us
7,null,null,So with such patience as we could command we waited near the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to emerge once more into the blessed light of day .
1757 6
 (3, 3),(3, 4),(3, 5),(3, 6),
1,null,null,Let it be so
2,null,null,For my part
3,happiness,rejoice,I rejoice that I have no tale of weeks of drunkenness
4,null,null,of brutal rape
5,null,null,treacherous murder
6,null,null,and almost unthinkable torture to tell .
1758 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprised,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,null,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style
5,null,null,With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
6,null,null,most men prefer the boarding-house
7,null,null,where
8,null,null,if they preserve the same commercial status which is a SINE QUA NON at the  "  home
9,null,null,"   they are treated like gentlemen
1759 10
 (8, 6),
1,null,null,While the final touch was being given to our task i
2,null,null,the hole boring through the tail fin all hands lay around in various picturesque attitudes
3,null,null,enjoying a refreshing smoke
4,null,null,care forgetting
5,null,null,While thus pleasantly employed
6,null,null,sudden death
7,null,null,like a bolt from the blue
8,sadness,terrible,leapt into our midst in a terrible form
9,null,null,The skipper was labouring hard at his task of cutting the hole for the tow line
10,null,null,when without warning the great fin swung back as if suddenly released from tremendous tension .
1760 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A ruined house
2,null,null,surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead
3,null,null,stood in the middle of this piece of land
4,surprise,curious,Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be
5,null,null,I asked the mate if he knew anything of it
6,null,null,He told me that an American named Halstead
7,null,null,with his family
8,null,null,lived here for years
9,null,null,visited only by an occasional whaler
10,null,null,to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time .
1761 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
2,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
3,null,null,To my mind
4,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
5,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1762 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Shall we take scorn instead of glory
2,surprise,marvel,The Briton will marvel that he was conquered by men whom he sees fear is enough to conquer
3,null,null,We struck them before with panic
4,null,null,shall we be panic-stricken by them
5,null,null,We scorned them when before us
1763 9
 (6, 9),
1,null,null,Nothing of advantage to our cargo was seen for a long time
2,null,null,which
3,null,null,although apparently what was to be expected
4,null,null,did not improve Captain Slocum 's temper
5,null,null,But
6,surprise,surprise,to the surprise of all
7,null,null,when we had arrived off the beautiful island of Hong Kong
8,null,null,to which we approached closely
9,null,null,we  "  raised "   a grand sperm whale .
1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,null,null,and the three hundred fathoms of line
3,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
4,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
5,happiness,Happily,Happily
6,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
7,null,null,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
8,null,null,Meanwhile
9,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1765 10
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,When morning dawned we hove to
2,null,null,the land being only dimly visible astern
3,null,null,and finished taking on board our  "  head matter "   without further incident
4,null,null,The danger past
5,happiness,pleased,we were all well pleased that the captain was below
6,null,null,for the work proceeded quite pleasantly under the genial rule of the mate
7,null,null,Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable
8,null,null,the work
9,null,null,with all its dis agreeable s
10,null,null,seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling .
1766 10
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,True
2,null,null,the man was but a unit of no special note among us
3,null,null,but death had conferred upon him a brevet rank
4,null,null,in virtue of which be dominated every thought
5,surprise,strange,It seemed strange to me that we who faced death so often and variously
6,null,null,until natural fear had become deadened by custom
7,null,null,should
8,null,null,now that one of our number lay a rapidly corrupting husk before us
9,null,null,be so tremendously impressed by the simple
10,null,null,inevitable fact .
1767 18
 (11, 12),
1,null,null,None of your high art here
2,null,null,but haul in hand over hand
3,null,null,the line being strong enough to land a 250 pound fish
4,null,null,Up he came
5,null,null,the beauty
6,null,null,all silver and scarlet and blue
7,null,null,five feet long if an inch
8,null,null,and weighing 35 pounds
9,null,null,Well
10,null,null,such a lot of astonished men I never saw
11,surprise,hardly believe their eyes,They could hardly believe their eyes
12,null,null,That such a daring innovation should be successful was hardly to be believed
13,null,null,even with the vigorous evidence before them
14,null,null,Even grim Captain Slocum came to look and turned upon me as I thought a less lowering brow than usual
15,null,null,while Mr
16,null,null,Count
17,null,null,the mate
18,null,null,fairly chuckled again at the thought of how the little Britisher had wiped the eyes of these veteran fishermen .
1768 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,How did a whale act
2,null,null,what were the first steps taken
3,null,null,what chance was there of being saved if your boat got smashed
4,null,null,and so on unto infinity
5,null,null,At last
6,disgust,tired,getting very tired of this  "  Portuguese Parliament "   of all talkers and no listeners
7,null,null,I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in
8,null,null,The harpooner s and other petty officers were grouped in the waist
9,null,null,earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales .
1769 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,I said as cheerfully as I could
2,null,null,"  All right
3,null,null,sir
4,null,null,"   trying to look unconcerned
5,null,null,telling myself not to be a coward
6,null,null,and all sorts of things
7,fear,scared,but the cold truth is that I was scared almost to death because I didnt know what was coming  .  However
8,null,null,I did the best thing under the circumstances
9,null,null,obeyed orders and looked steadily astern
10,null,null,or up into the bronzed impassive face of my chief
11,null,null,who towered above me
12,null,null,scanning with eagle eyes the sea ahead .
1770 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He raised a gigantic tail on high
2,null,null,threshing the water with deafening blows
3,null,null,rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth
4,anger,agony,I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes
5,null,null,for Mr
6,null,null,Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger
7,null,null,although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan
8,null,null,In the agitated condition of the sea
9,null,null,it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to un ship the tall mast
10,null,null,which was of course the first thing to be done .
1771 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,So we toiled watch and watch
2,null,null,six hours on and six off
3,null,null,the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty
4,null,null,and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great
5,fear,dangerous,there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business
6,null,null,That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil
7,null,null,Some of these were of enormous size
8,null,null,containing 350 gallons when full
9,null,null,and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk .
1772 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It will not
2,null,null,of course
3,null,null,have escaped the reader 's notice that I have not hitherto attempted to give any details concerning the structure of the whale just dealt with
4,null,null,The omission is intentional
5,null,null,During this
6,null,null,our first attempt at real whaling
7,fear,disturbed,my mind was far too disturbed by the novelty and danger of the position in which I found myself for the first time
8,null,null,for me to pay any intelligent attention to the party of the second part .
1773 7
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch
2,null,null,but now
3,happiness,great joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings
5,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
6,null,null,having been absent only two hours
7,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals .
1774 7
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,We at once returned to the ship
2,null,null,having been absent only two hours
3,null,null,during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals
4,null,null,Not one of the crew had ever seen or heard of such fishing before
5,happiness,pride,so my pride and pleasure may he imagined
6,null,null,A little learning may be a dangerous thing at times
7,null,null,but it certainly is often handy to have about you .
1775 7
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,He made a fearful to-do over it
2,null,null,rolling completely over several times backward and forward
3,null,null,at the same time smiting the sea with his mighty tail
4,null,null,making an almost deafening noise and pother
5,happiness,comfortable,But we were comfortable enough
6,null,null,while we un shipped the mast and made ready for action
7,null,null,being sufficiently far away from him to escape the full effect of his gambols .
1776 17
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,During the conflict I had not noticed what now claimed attention  several great masses of white
2,null,null,semi-transparent looking substance floating about
3,null,null,of huge size and irregular shape
4,surprise,curious,But one of these curious lumps came floating by as we lay
5,null,null,tugged at by several fish
6,null,null,and I immediately asked the mate if he could tell me what it was and where it came from
7,null,null,He told me that
8,null,null,when dying
9,null,null,the cachalot always ejected the contents of his stomach
10,null,null,which were invariably composed of such masses as we saw before us
11,null,null,that he believed the stuff to be portions of big cuttle fish
12,null,null,bitten off by the whale for the purpose of swallowing
13,null,null,but he wasnt sure
14,null,null,Anyhow
15,null,null,I could haul this piece alongside now
16,null,null,if I liked
17,null,null,and see .
1777 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Anyhow
2,null,null,I could haul this piece alongside now
3,null,null,if I liked
4,null,null,and see
5,surprise,wondering,Secretly wondering at the indifference shown by this officer of forty years whaling experience to such a wonderful fact as appeared to be here presented
6,null,null,I thanked him
7,null,null,and
8,null,null,sticking the boat hook into the lump
9,null,null,drew it alongside .
1778 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,At seven bells ( 7
2,null,null,) it was  "  turn to "   all hands again
3,null,null,The  "  junk  "   was hooked on to both cutting tackles
4,null,null,and the windlass manned by everybody who could get hold
5,null,null,Slowly the enormous mass rose
6,null,null,canting the ship heavily as it came
7,disgust,complained,while every stick and rope aloft complained of the great strain upon them
8,null,null,When at last it was safely shipped
9,null,null,and the tackles cast off
10,null,null,the size of this small portion of a full-grown cachalot 's body could be realized
11,null,null,not before .
1779 13
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Here
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,we were better off than in an ordinary merchantman
4,disgust,mad,where doldrums are enough to drive you mad
5,null,null,The one object being to get along
6,null,null,it is incessant  "  pully hauly
7,null,null,"   setting and taking in sail
8,null,null,in order
9,null,null,on the one hand
10,null,null,to lose no time
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,on the other
13,null,null,to lose no sails .
1780 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1781 5
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,cheers,With hearty cheers from the whole population
2,null,null,we shoved off and ploughed through the kelp seaweed again
3,null,null,When we got clear of it
4,null,null,we found the swell heavier than when we had come
5,null,null,and a rough journey back to the ship was the result .
1782 7
 (1, 1),
1,fear,afraid,The men were afraid to go on to the sick list
2,null,null,Nothing short of total inability to continue would have prevented them from working
3,null,null,such was the terror with which that man had inspired us all
4,null,null,It may be said that we were a pack of cowards
5,null,null,who
6,null,null,without the courage to demand better treatment
7,null,null,deserved all we got .
1783 8
 (3, 1),(3, 2),
1,null,null,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
2,null,null,half starved and hopeless
3,sadness,broken,their spirit had been so broken
4,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
5,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
6,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves
7,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
8,null,null,as I have before noted
1784 6
 (3, 3),(3, 6),
1,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
2,null,null,as I have before noted
3,disgust,resented,but I was perfectly well aware that the slightest attempt on my part to show that I resented our common treatment would meet with the most brutal repression
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,in addition
6,null,null,I might look for a dreadful time of it for the rest of the voyage .
1785 14
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,The share of profits was so small
2,null,null,and the time taken to earn it so long
3,null,null,such a number of clothes were worn out and destroyed by us
4,null,null,only to be replaced from the ship 's slop chest at high prices
5,null,null,that I had quite resigned myself to the prospect of leaving the vessel in debt
6,null,null,whenever that desirable event might happen
7,null,null,Since
8,null,null,therefore
9,null,null,I had never made it a practice to repine at the inevitable
10,sadness,unhappy,and make myself unhappy by the contemplation of misfortunes I was powerless to prevent
11,null,null,I tried to interest myself as far as was possible in gathering information
12,null,null,although at that time I had no idea
13,null,null,beyond a general thirst for knowledge
14,null,null,that what I was now learning would ever he of any service to me .
1786 12
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,fairly good,The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good
2,null,null,although subject to electric storms of the most terrible aspect
3,null,null,but perfectly harmless
4,null,null,On the second evening after rounding Cape St
5,null,null,Mary
6,null,null,we were proceeding
7,null,null,as usual
8,null,null,under very scanty sail
9,null,null,rather enjoying the mild
10,null,null,balmy air
11,null,null,scent laden
12,null,null,from Madagascar .
1787 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good
2,sadness,terrible,although subject to electric storms of the most terrible aspect
3,null,null,but perfectly harmless
4,null,null,On the second evening after rounding Cape St
5,null,null,Mary
6,null,null,we were proceeding
7,null,null,as usual
8,null,null,under very scanty sail
9,null,null,rather enjoying the mild
10,null,null,balmy air
11,null,null,scent laden
12,null,null,from Madagascar .
1788 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,There was no thunder
2,null,null,but a low hissing and a crackling which did not amount to noise
3,null,null,although distinctly audible to all
4,sadness,unpleasant,Sensations most unpleasant of pricking and general irritation were felt by every one
5,null,null,according to their degree of susceptibility .
1789 13
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,We saw none
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats
4,null,null,there being no wind
5,null,null,While busy at this uninteresting pastime
6,null,null,one of the boats slipped away
7,null,null,returning presently with a fine turtle
8,surprise,surprised,which they had surprised during his morning 's nap
9,null,null,One of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat 's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,diving deep
12,null,null,came up underneath him
13,null,null,seizing with crossed hands the two hind flippers .
1790 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,With the exception of the numerous native dhows that crept lazily about
2,null,null,we saw no vessels as we gradually drew out of the Mozambique Channel and stood away towards the Line
3,fear,dreaded,The part of the Indian Ocean in which we now found ourselves is much dreaded by merchantmen
4,null,null,who give it a wide berth on account of the numerous banks
5,null,null,islets
6,null,null,and dangerous currents with which it abounds .
1791 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Doubtless because he himself was much fatigued
2,null,null,the mate allowed him to run at his will
3,null,null,without for the time attempting to haul any closer to him
4,happiness,grateful,and very grateful the short rest was to us
5,null,null,But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water
6,null,null,coming up BEHIND us to rush off again in the opposite direction at undiminished speed .
1792 10
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Up till now we had not succeeded in getting home a single lance
2,null,null,the foe was becoming warier
3,null,null,while the strain was certainly telling upon our nerves
4,null,null,So Mr
5,null,null,Count got out his bomb gun
6,null,null,shouting at the same time to Mr
7,null,null,Cruce to do the same
8,sadness,hated,They both hated these weapons
9,null,null,nor ever used them if they could help it
10,null,null,but what was to be done
1793 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,We got the whale cut in as usual without any incident worth mentioning
2,surprise,curiosity,except that the peculiar shape of the jaw made it an object of great curiosity to all of us who were new to the whale fishing
3,null,null,Such malformations are not very rare
4,null,null,They are generally thought to occur when the animal is young
5,null,null,and its bones soft
1794 13
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,As soon as they had got far enough away from their native element
2,null,null,we rushed upon them
3,null,null,and captured them both
4,null,null,so that when the boat arrived we were not empty-handed
5,null,null,We had also a  "  jumper
6,null,null,"   or blouse
7,null,null,full of eggs
8,null,null,and a couple of immense bunches of cocoa nuts
9,happiness,happy,When we got on board we felt quite happy
10,null,null,and
11,null,null,for the first time since leaving America
12,null,null,we had a little singing
13,null,null,Shall I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey 's hymns
1795 11
 (7, 7),(7, 8),
1,null,null,It was but a school of kogia
2,null,null,or  "  short headed "   cachalots
3,null,null,but as we secured five of them
4,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
5,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
6,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
7,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
8,null,null,they were so lively
9,null,null,but as for danger well
10,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
11,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1796 3
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats
2,null,null,Early on the second day of warning they had been hoisted to the topmost notch of the cranes
3,null,null,and secured as thoroughly as experience could suggest
1797 9
 (1, 4),
1,sadness,terrible,The terrible day wore on
2,null,null,without any lightening of the tempest
3,null,null,till noon
4,null,null,when the wind suddenly fell to a calm
5,null,null,Until that time
6,null,null,the sea
7,null,null,although heavy
8,null,null,was not vicious or irregular
9,null,null,and we had not shipped any heavy water at all .
1798 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In two minutes we were speeding away towards her
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,making a sweep round her stern
4,null,null,prepared to board her
5,disgust,awful,But we were met by a stench so awful that Mr
6,null,null,Count would not proceed
7,null,null,and at once returned to the ship
8,null,null,The boat was quickly hoisted again
9,null,null,and the ship manoeuvred to pass close to windward of the derelict .
1799 10
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,It is
2,null,null,perhaps
3,null,null,hardly necessary to say that we promptly hauled our wind
4,null,null,and placed a good distance between us and that awful load of death as soon as possible
5,sadness,Poor,Poor wretches
6,null,null,What terrible calamity had befallen them
7,null,null,we could not guess
8,null,null,whatever it was
9,null,null,it had been complete
10,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done .

 (4, 4),
1,null,null,whatever it was
2,null,null,it had been complete
3,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done
4,sadness,pity,It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo
5,null,null,and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee .
1801 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Next day
2,null,null,and for a whole week after
3,null,null,we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work
4,null,null,the  "  Ancient Mariner "
5,surprise,amazing,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
1802 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination
2,surprise,astounding,For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding
3,null,null,Very few sailors have noticed the sickening condition of the ocean when the life-giving breeze totally fails for any length of time
4,null,null,or
5,null,null,if they have
6,null,null,they have said but little about it .
1803 14
 (9, 9),(9, 10),
1,null,null,A light breeze then sprang up
2,null,null,aided by which we crept around Achin Head
3,null,null,the northern point of the great island of Sumatra
4,null,null,Like some gigantic beacon
5,null,null,the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene
6,null,null,Pulo Way
7,null,null,or Water Island
8,null,null,looked very inviting
9,happiness,glad,and I should have been glad to visit a place so well known to seamen by sight
10,null,null,but so little known by actual touching at
11,null,null,Our recent stay at the Cocos
12,null,null,however
13,null,null,had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative
14,null,null,unless we might be compelled by accident
1804 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Therefore
2,sadness,rough,we had all a rough time of it while his angry fit lasted
3,null,null,which was a whole week
4,null,null,or until all was shipshape again
5,null,null,Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo
6,null,null,never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business .
1805 13
 (10, 1),(10, 2),(10, 3),(10, 4),
1,null,null,The sorely wounded monster
2,null,null,with one tremendous expiration
3,null,null,rolled over and over swift as thought towards his aggressor
4,null,null,literally burying the boat beneath his vast bulk
5,null,null,Now
6,null,null,one would have thought surely
7,null,null,upon seeing this
8,null,null,that none of that boat 's crew would ever have been seen again
9,null,null,Nevertheless
10,surprise,strange,strange as it may appear
11,null,null,out of that seething lather of foam
12,null,null,all six heads emerged again in an instant
13,null,null,but on the OTHER side of the great creature .
1806 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The truth of Mr
2,null,null,Count 's forecast was verified to the hilt
3,null,null,for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about
4,null,null,the body that he was unable to move
5,null,null,while one of the hands
6,null,null,a Portuguese
7,null,null,was injured internally
8,null,null,and seemed very bad indeed
9,sadness,sorry,Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones
10,null,null,we should have scoffed at the notion
11,null,null,and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart .
1807 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,fear,anxious,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,null,null,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant .

6,null,null,Besides
7,null,null,it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship
8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1809 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,They were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed
2,null,null,My democratic sentiments are deeply seated
3,null,null,but I do believe in authority
4,null,null,and respect for it being rigidly enforced
5,fear,upset,so this uncalled for scene upset me
6,null,null,making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson
7,null,null,They got one .

1811 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,As I bent to my oar
2,sadness,sorry,I felt very sorry for what had happened
3,null,null,Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer
4,null,null,which
5,null,null,according to the severe code under which we lived
6,null,null,merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted
7,null,null,and lasting for the rest of the voyage .
1812 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,This sort of thing was right in his line
2,null,null,Naturally cruel
3,happiness,enjoy,he seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself in the prospect of making human beings twist and writhe in pain

1814 12
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Meanwhile another ship was working up from to leeward
2,null,null,having evidently noted our movements
3,null,null,or else
4,null,null,like the albatross
5,null,null,"  smelt whale
6,null,null,"   no great distance to windward of him
7,happiness,exciting,Waiting for that whale to rise was one of the most exciting experiences we had gone through as yet
8,null,null,with two other ships so near
9,null,null,Everybody 's nerves seemed strung up to concert pitch
10,null,null,and it was quite a relief when from half a dozen throats at once burst the cry
11,null,null,"  There she white waters
12,null,null,Ah blo o o o w
1815 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Not seeing what had happened to his iron
2,null,null,or knowing that we were fast
3,null,null,the other harpooner promptly hurled his second iron
4,null,null,which struck solidly
5,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle
6,fear,bad,but our position was rather bad
7,null,null,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear
8,null,null,we were struggling frantically to get our sail down
9,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .
1816 5
 (3, 2),(3, 3),
1,null,null,It was a very pretty tangle
2,null,null,but our position was rather bad
3,anger,rage,The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear
4,null,null,we were struggling frantically to get our sail down
5,null,null,and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us .
1817 13
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Our chief
2,null,null,foaming at the mouth with rage and excitement
3,null,null,was screeching inarticulate blasphemy at the other mate
4,null,null,who
5,null,null,not knowing what was the matter
6,null,null,was yelling back all his copious vocabulary of abuse
7,happiness,glad,I felt very glad the whale was between us
8,null,null,or there would surely have been murder done
9,null,null,At last
10,null,null,out drops the iron
11,null,null,leaving a jagged hole you could put your arm through
12,null,null,wasnt Mr
13,null,null,Count mad
1818 6
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,wasnt Mr
2,null,null,Count mad
3,anger,rage,I really thought he would split with rage
4,null,null,for it was impossible for us to go on with that hole in our bilge
5,null,null,The second mate came alongside and took our line as the whale was just commencing to sound
6,null,null,thus setting us free .
1819 14
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,And still the whale kept going steadily down
2,null,null,down
3,null,null,down
4,null,null,Already he was on the second boat 's lines
5,null,null,and taking them out faster than ever
6,null,null,Had we been alone
7,null,null,this persistence on his part
8,disgust,annoying,though annoying
9,null,null,would not have mattered much
10,null,null,but
11,null,null,with so many others in company
12,null,null,the possibilities of complication
13,null,null,should we need to slip our end
14,null,null,were numerous .
1820 12
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,In this optimistic mood
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,I gaily flung myself into my place in the mate 's boat one morning
4,null,null,as we were departing in chase of a magnificent cachalot that had been raised just after breakfast
5,happiness,satisfaction,There were no other vessels in sight much to our satisfaction  the wind was light
6,null,null,with a cloudless sky
7,null,null,and the whale was dead to leeward of us
8,null,null,We sped along at a good rate towards our prospective victim
9,null,null,who was
10,null,null,in his leisurely enjoyment of life
11,null,null,calmly lolling on the surface
12,null,null,occasionally lifting his enormous tail out of water and letting it fall flat upon the surface with a boom audible for miles .
1821 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When I recovered
2,null,null,I was snug in my bunk aboard
3,null,null,but aching in every joint
4,null,null,and as sore as if I had been pounded with a club until I was bruised all over
5,null,null,During the day Mr
6,happiness,kind,Count was kind enough to pay me a visit
7,null,null,With his usual luck
8,null,null,he had escaped without the slightest injury
1822 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,annoyed,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders .
1823 7
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,When I told Samuela
2,null,null,of his chance
3,null,null,he was beside himself with joy
4,fear,scared,As to his being scared
5,null,null,the idea was manifestly absurd
6,null,null,He was as pleased with the prospect as it was possible for a man to be
7,null,null,and hardly able to contain himself for impatience to be off .
1824 10
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,happiness,joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,null,null,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .

3,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
4,null,null,three boats were fast
5,null,null,only myself keeping out
6,null,null,in accordance with my instructions
7,disgust,distraught,Samuela was almost distraught with rage and grief at the condition of things
8,null,null,I quite pitied him
9,null,null,although I was anything but pleased myself .
1827 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thenceforward for another hour
2,null,null,in spite of all our efforts
3,null,null,we could not get within striking distance
4,null,null,mainly because of the close attention of the cow
5,null,null,which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother
6,disgust,impatient,I was getting so impatient of this hindrance
7,null,null,that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow
8,null,null,though I felt convinced that
9,null,null,if I did
10,null,null,I should spoil a good job .
1828 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We took them on board
2,null,null,and the boat returned again
3,null,null,By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern sheets
4,null,null,I felt sure
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
7,null,null,in fact
8,fear,afraid,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
9,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
10,null,null,We hauled steadily away
11,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
12,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1829 9
 (8, 8),(8, 9),
1,null,null,The ceaseless motion of the vessel rocking at the centre of a circular space of blue
2,null,null,with a perfectly symmetrical dome of azure enclosing her above
3,null,null,un flecked by a single cloud
4,null,null,becomes at last almost unbearable from its changeless sameness of environment
5,null,null,Were it not for the trivial round and common task of everyday ship duty
6,null,null,some of the crew must become idiotic
7,null,null,or
8,anger,rage,in sheer rage at the want of interest in their lives
9,null,null,commit mutiny .
1830 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Such a weary time was ours for full four weeks after sighting Christmas Island
2,sadness,exhausted,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
3,null,null,for never a spout did we see
4,null,null,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
5,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time .
1831 6
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,but then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related .
1832 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,for his first move was to come straight for me with a furious rush
2,null,null,carrying the war into the enemy 's country with a vengeance It must be remembered that I was but young
3,null,null,and a comparatively new hand at this sort of thing
4,fear,scared,so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent
5,null,null,I hope I shall be excused  .  Remembering
6,null,null,however
7,null,null,that all our lives depended on keeping cool
8,null,null,I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces
9,null,null,but compel myself to think and act calmly
10,null,null,since I was responsible for others If the animal had not been in so blind a fury
11,null,null,I am afraid my task would have been much harder

8,null,null,If the animal had not been in so blind a fury
9,fear,afraid,I am afraid my task would have been much harder
10,null,null,but he was mad
11,null,null,and his savage rushes were
12,null,null,though disquieting
13,null,null,unsystematic and clumsy .
1834 12
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,When I returned to a consciousness of external things
2,null,null,I was for some time perfectly still
3,null,null,looking at the sky
4,null,null,totally unable to realize what had happened or where I was
5,null,null,Presently the smiling
6,null,null,pleasant face of Samuel bent over me
7,null,null,Meeting my gratified look of recognition
8,happiness,delight,he set up a perfect yell of delight
9,null,null,"  So glad
10,null,null,so glad you blonga life
11,null,null,No go Davy Jonesy dis time
12,null,null,hay
1835 4
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,I put my hand out to help myself to a sitting posture
2,null,null,and touched blubber
3,fear,startled,That startled me so that I sprung up as if shot
4,null,null,Then I took in the situation at a glance .
1836 9
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Samuela and Polly set to work with their sheath knives
2,null,null,and soon excavated a space in the blubber to enable them to reach the meat
3,null,null,Then they cut off some good-sized junks
4,null,null,and divided it up
5,null,null,It was not half bad
6,null,null,and as we chewed on the tough black fibre
7,happiness,smiling,I could hardly help smiling as I thought how queer a Christmas dinner we were having
8,null,null,But eating soon heightened our thirst
9,null,null,and our real sufferings then began .
1837 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The captain shook hands with me cordially
2,null,null,pooh poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade
3,happiness,delight,but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe
4,null,null,The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats
5,null,null,though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him
6,null,null,that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once
7,null,null,working all night .
1838 9
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,We who had been rescued
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,were summarily ordered below by the skipper
4,null,null,and forbidden
5,sadness,pain,on pain of his severe displeasure
6,null,null,to reappear until the following morning
7,null,null,This great privilege we gladly availed ourselves of
8,null,null,awaking at daylight quite well and fit
9,null,null,not a bit the worse for our queer experience of the previous day .
1839 9
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,For unto us a Child is born
2,null,null,unto us a Son is given "   again and again billows and billows of glory
3,null,null,I gasped for breath
4,null,null,shook like one in an ague fit
5,null,null,the tears ran down in a continuous stream
6,surprise,amazed,while people stared amazed at me
7,null,null,thinking
8,null,null,I suppose
9,null,null,that I was another drunken sailor .
1840 6
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,disgust,disgust,I have no doubt whatever that some of the gentry who swear at large about the evils of missionaries would have been loud in their disgust at the entire absence of drink and debauchery
2,null,null,and the prevalence of what they would doubtless characterize as adjective hypocrisy on the part of the natives
3,null,null,but no decent man could help rejoicing at the peace
4,null,null,the security
5,null,null,and friendliness manifested on every hand
6,null,null,nor help awarding unstinted praise to whoever had been the means of bringing about so desirable a state of things .
1841 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animal ism as we witnessed at Honolulu
2,happiness,pleased,What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship
3,null,null,All the worship
4,null,null,all the management of affairs
5,null,null,was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves
6,null,null,and excellently well did they manage everything .
1842 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,What a sigh
2,null,null,One looked at the other inquiring ly
3,happiness,satisfied,but the repetition of that long expiration satisfied us all that it was the placid breathing of the whale we sought somewhere close at hand
4,null,null,The light grew rapidly better
5,null,null,and we strained our eyes in every direction to discover the whereabouts of our friend
6,null,null,but
7,null,null,for some minutes without result .
1843 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,News of our coming had preceded us
2,null,null,and the whole native population appeared to be afloat to make us welcome
3,null,null,The air rang again with their shouts of rejoicing
4,happiness,gorgeous feast,for our catch represented to them a gorgeous feast
5,null,null,such as they had not indulged in for many a day
6,null,null,The flesh of the humpbacked whale is not at all bad
7,null,null,being but little inferior to that of the porpoise
1844 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,That being settled
2,null,null,we anchored the boat
3,null,null,and lit pipes
4,null,null,preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances
5,disgust,troubling,the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf
6,null,null,Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light
7,null,null,shed in the wake of no ordinary sized fish
8,null,null,probably an immense shark .
1845 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But we lost no time in getting back to the ship
2,null,null,where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into
3,null,null,The captain
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,was very kind
6,happiness,pleasure,expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again
7,null,null,although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future
8,null,null,A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure
9,null,null,so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again .
1846 12
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But
2,null,null,alas for the fruit of our labours
3,null,null,Those hungry monsters had collected in thousands
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,to judge from what we were able to see of the body
6,surprise,alarmingly,they had reduced its value alarmingly
7,null,null,However
8,null,null,we commenced towing
9,null,null,and were getting along fairly well
10,null,null,when a long spur of reef to leeward of us
11,null,null,over which the sea was breaking frightfully
12,null,null,seemed to be stretching farther out to intercept us before we could get into smooth water .
1847 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Taking stock of him quietly during our day-long leisurely cruises in the boat
2,null,null,I often wondered whether his mind still kept its gloomy forebodings
3,null,null,and brooded over his tragical life-history
4,null,null,I never dared to speak to him on the subject
5,fear,fear,for fear of arousing what I hoped was growing too faint for remembrance
6,null,null,But at times I saw him in the moonlit evenings sitting on the rail alone
7,null,null,steadfastly gazing down into the star besprent waters beneath him
8,null,null,as if coveting their unruffled peace .
1848 4

1,null,null,A corn cob cigarette closed the banquet
2,null,null,After expressing my thanks
3,sadness,uneasiness,I noticed that the pain of his leg was giving my friend considerable uneasiness
4,null,null,which he was stolidly enduring upon my account rather than appear discourteous ly anxious to get rid of me .

1,null,null,islands
2,null,null,air
3,null,null,and sea all shimmering in an enchanted haze
4,null,null,and silence scarcely broken by the tender ripple of the gently parted waters before the boat 's steady keel though these joys have all been lost to me
5,null,null,and I in  "  populous city pent "   endure the fading years
6,null,null,I would not barter the memory of them for more than I can say
7,happiness,sweet,so sweet it is to me
8,null,null,And
9,null,null,then
10,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable
11,null,null,so free from anything to regret .

2,null,null,then
3,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable

2,null,null,the New Hebrides
3,null,null,and kindred spots with all their savage
4,null,null,bestial orgies of alternate unbridled lust and unnamable cruelty
5,null,null,Let it be so
6,null,null,For my part
7,happiness,rejoice,I rejoice that I have no tale of weeks of drunkenness
8,null,null,of brutal rape
9,null,null,treacherous murder
10,null,null,and almost unthinkable torture to tell .
1852 5
 (3, 3),(3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprised,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,null,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
5,null,null,most men prefer the boarding-house .

 (1, 1),
1,surprise,startling,Its effect upon him was startling and immediate
2,null,null,He rushed off at so furious a rate dead to windward that for a great while we had all our work cut out to keep her free by baling
3,null,null,The sea had risen a little
4,null,null,and as we leapt from one wave to another the spray flew over us in an almost continuous cloud .
1854 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Before we left finally for New Zealand
2,null,null,every one of those Kanakas was as much at home in the whale boats as he would have been in a canoe
3,null,null,Of course they were greatly helped by their entire familiarity with the water
4,fear,dread,which took from them all that dread of being drowned which hampers the white  "  greenie "   so sorely
5,null,null,besides which
6,null,null,the absolute confidence they had in our prowess amongst the whales freed them from any fear on that head .
1855 10
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,A ruined house
2,null,null,surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead
3,null,null,stood in the middle of this piece of land
4,surprise,curious,Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be
5,null,null,I asked the mate if he knew anything of it
6,null,null,He told me that an American named Halstead
7,null,null,with his family
8,null,null,lived here for years
9,null,null,visited only by an occasional whaler
10,null,null,to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time .
1856 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Rushing out of their house
2,null,null,they saw the heavens bespread with an awful pall of smoke
3,null,null,the underside of which was glowing with the reflected fires of some vast furnace
4,fear,terror,Their terror was increased by a smart shower of falling ashes and the reverberations of subterranean thunders
5,null,null,At first they thought of flight in their boat
6,null,null,not reckoning the wide stretch of sea which rolled between them and the nearest land
7,null,null,but the height and frequency of the breakers then prevailing made that impossible .
1857 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Though they had but been dwellers on the threshold of the mountain
2,null,null,as it were
3,null,null,and any extension of their territory impossible by reason of the insurmountable barrier around them
4,happiness,untroubled,they had led an untroubled life
5,null,null,all unknowing of the fearful forces beneath their feet
6,null,null,But now they found the foundations of the rocks beneath breaking up
7,null,null,that withering
8,null,null,incessant shower of ashes and scoriae destroyed all their crops
1858 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,They were so tame and inquisitive that we had no difficulty in securing a few by the simple process of knocking them over with sticks
2,null,null,From the main branch of a large tree hung a big honey comb
3,null,null,out of which the honey was draining upon the earth
4,null,null,Around it buzzed a busy concourse of bees
5,happiness,enjoyment,who appeared to us so formidable that we decided to leave them to the enjoyment of their sweet store
6,null,null,in case we should invite an attack .
1859 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Our Kanakas
2,null,null,too
3,null,null,were overjoyed to find compatriots among the visitors
4,null,null,and settled down to a steady stream of talk which lasted
5,null,null,without intermission
6,null,null,the whole night through
7,null,null,It was a wonderful exhibition of tongue wagging
8,disgust,puzzled,though what it was all about puzzled me greatly .
1860 11
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,Every Londoner knows how strongly that beautiful scent appeals to him
2,null,null,even when wafted from draggled branches borne slumwards by tramping urchins who have been far afield despoiling the trees of their lovely blossoms
3,null,null,careless of the damage they have been doing
4,null,null,But to me
5,null,null,who had not seen a bit for years
6,null,null,the flood of feeling undammed by that odorous breath
7,fear,overwhelming,was overwhelming
8,null,null,I could hardly tear myself away from the spot
9,null,null,and
10,null,null,when at last I did
11,null,null,found myself continually turning to try and catch another whiff of one of the most beautiful scents in the world .
1861 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Making myself at home with him
2,null,null,I desired to know what brought him so far from the  "  big smoke
3,null,null,"   and on board a whaler of all places in the world
4,null,null,He told me he had been a Pickford 's van driver
5,null,null,but had emigrated to New Zealand
6,disgust,did not at all like,finding that he did not at all like himself in the new country
7,null,null,Trying to pick and choose instead of manfully choosing a pick and shovel for a beginning
8,null,null,he got hard up .
1862 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,There were sixteen white men on board the CHANCE
2,null,null,including the skipper
3,null,null,drawn as usual from various European and American sources
4,null,null,the rest of her large crew of over forty all told being made up of Maories and half-breeds
5,null,null,One common interest united them
6,null,null,making them the most jolly crowd I ever saw their devotion to their commander
7,null,null,There was here to be found no jealousy of the Maories being officers and harpooner s
8,null,null,no black looks or discontented murmuring
9,happiness,satisfied,all hands seemed particularly well satisfied with their lot in all its bearings
10,null,null,so that
11,null,null,although the old tub was malodorous enough to turn even a pretty strong stomach
12,null,null,it was a leasure to visit her cheerful crowd for the sake of their enlivening society .
1863 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,No one could gainsay that they had good reason
2,null,null,but I really feared for a time that we should have  "  ructions
3,null,null,"   As Paddy said
4,anger,angry,it was not wise or dignified for those officers to be so angry with him on account of his success
5,null,null,which he frankly owned was due almost entirely to the local knowledge he possessed
6,null,null,gained in many years study of the immediate neighbourhood
7,null,null,He declared that
8,null,null,as far as the technical duties of whale fishing went
9,null,null,all the Americans could beat him hollow
1864 9
 (5, 7),
1,null,null,His crew
2,null,null,on the impulse of the moment

1865 10
 (7, 5),
1,null,null,At the close of our operations the welcome news was made public that four more fish like the present one would fill us bung up
2,null,null,and that we should then
3,null,null,after a brief visit to the Bluff
4,null,null,start direct for home
5,null,null,This announcement
6,null,null,though expected for some time past
7,surprise,amazing,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
8,null,null,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
9,null,null,where stern
10,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule .

5,null,null,where stern
6,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule
7,null,null,The captain
8,null,null,well pleased with the eagerness manifested
9,null,null,had his boat manned for a trip to the entrance of the harbour
10,null,null,to see what the weather was like outside
11,null,null,since it was not possible to judge from where the ship lay .
1867 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Satisfied that our days in the southern hemisphere were numbered
2,null,null,and all anxiety to point her head for home
3,happiness,pleasing,this news was most pleasing
4,null,null,putting all of us in the best of humours
5,null,null,and provoking quite an entertainment of song and dance until nearly four bells .
1868 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,not far enough to get anywhere that an anchor might hold
2,null,null,and there to leeward
3,null,null,within less than a dozen miles
4,null,null,loomed grim and gloomy one of the most terrific rock bound coasts in the world
5,null,null,The shift of wind had placed the CHANCE farther to leeward than all the rest
6,null,null,a good mile and a half nearer the shore
7,null,null,and we could well imagine how anxiously her movements were being watched by the others
8,null,null,who
9,sadness,jealousy,in spite of their jealousy of his good luck
10,null,null,knew well and appreciated fully Paddy 's marvellous seamanship
11,null,null,as well as his unparalleled knowledge of the coast .
1869 15
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,however
2,null,null,showed no sign of doing so
3,null,null,although they all neared
4,null,null,with an accelerated drift
5,null,null,that point from whence no seamanship could deliver them
6,null,null,and where death inevitable
7,null,null,cruel
8,null,null,awaited them without hope of escape
9,fear,dangerous,The part of the coast upon which they were apparently driving was about as dangerous and impracticable as any in the world
10,null,null,A gigantic barrier of black
11,null,null,naked rock
12,null,null,extending for several hundred yards
13,null,null,rose sheer from the sea beneath
14,null,null,like the side of an ironclad
15,null,null,up to a height of seven or eight hundred feet .
1870 11
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,For the next four days and nights
2,null,null,during which the wind prevented the CHANCE from leaving us
3,null,null,our old ship was a scene of wild revelry
4,null,null,that ceased not through the twenty-four hours  revelry entirely unassisted by strong waters
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,the natural ebullient gaiety of men who were free from anxiety on any account whatever
7,null,null,rejoicing over the glad consummation of more than two years toil

9,null,null,on the other
10,happiness,joy,a splendid sympathy in joy manifested by the satisfied crew under the genial command of Captain Gilroy
11,null,null,With their cheerful help we made wonderful progress

2,null,null,gloomier
3,null,null,and colder grew the weather
4,null,null,until
5,null,null,reduced to two topsails and a reefed foresail
6,null,null,we were scudding dead before the gale for all we were worth
7,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
8,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
9,null,null,To my mind
10,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
11,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1872 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,You are running before the wind and waves
2,null,null,sometimes deep in the valley between two liquid mountains

5,null,null,trying to decide whether it or you are going the faster
6,null,null,when suddenly there seems to be a hush
7,null,null,almost a lull
8,null,null,in the uproar
9,null,null,You look astern
10,null,null,and see a wall of water rising majestically higher and higher
11,null,null,at the same time drawing nearer and nearer .
1873 6

6,null,null,and skewering the contents of a pair of shells with his iron fork held it out toward Oliver .
1876 10
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,These lines seemed all the deeper to-night
2,null,null,Only a few hours before
3,null,null,Richard had come to her
4,null,null,while Malachi was arranging his clothes
5,null,null,with the joyful news of a new device which he had developed during the day for his motor
6,null,null,He could hardly wait to tell her
7,null,null,he had said
8,happiness,joyful,The news was anything but joyful to her
9,null,null,She knew what it meant she knew what sums had been wasted on the other devices
10,null,null,involving losses which at this time they could so little afford .

2,null,null,In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose
3,fear,fearing,fearing to wound his pride
4,null,null,she had put it solely on the ground of his settling down to some work .
1881 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Frode was thus forced to quit the wars of the East and fought a great battle in Sweden with his sister Swanhwid
2,null,null,in which he was beaten
3,null,null,So he got on board a skiff
4,null,null,and sailed stealthily in a circuit
5,null,null,seeking some way of boring through the enemy 's fleet
6,surprise,surprised,When surprised by his sister and asked why he was rowing silently and following divers meandering courses
7,null,null,he cut short her inquiry by a similar question
1882 12
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,When he had done these things
2,null,null,and gone back to his own land
3,null,null,one Skat entertained him at a banquet
4,null,null,desirous to mingle his toilsome warfare with joyous licence
5,null,null,Frode was lying in his house
6,null,null,in royal fashion
7,null,null,upon cushions of cloth of gold
8,null,null,and a certain Hunding challenged him to fight
9,null,null,Then
10,null,null,though he had bent his mind to the joys of wassail
11,happiness,delight,he had more delight in the prospect of a fray than in the presence of a feast
12,null,null,and wound up the supper with a duel and the duel with a triumph .
1883 14
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Now Urse
2,null,null,who had watched her chance for the deed of guile
3,null,null,on the third day of the banquet
4,null,null,without her husband ever dreaming of such a thing
5,null,null,put all the king 's wealth into carriages
6,null,null,and going out stealthily
7,null,null,stole away from her own dwelling and fled in the glimmering twilight
8,null,null,departing with her son
9,fear,fear,Thrilled with fear of her husband 's pursuit
10,null,null,and utterly despairing of escape beyond
11,null,null,she begged and bade her companions to cast away the money
12,null,null,declaring that they must lose either life or riches
13,null,null,the short and only path to safety lay in flinging away the treasure
14,null,null,nor could any aid to escape be found save in the loss of their possessions .
1884 13
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,So Athisl
2,null,null,when he saw the necklace that he had given to Rolf left among the other golden ornaments
3,null,null,gazed fixedly upon the dearest treasure of his avarice
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,in order to pick up the plunder
6,null,null,glued his knees to the earth and deigned to stoop his royalty unto greed
7,null,null,Rolf

9,happiness,smiled,smiled at the sight of a man prostrated by his own gifts
10,null,null,just as if he were seeking covetously to regain what he had craftily yielded up
11,null,null,The Swedes were content with their booty
12,null,null,and Rolf quickly retired to his ships
13,null,null,and managed to escape by rowing violently .

1,null,null,If thou refuse thy daughter
2,happiness,pleased,consent to fight :  thou must needs grant one thing or the other We wish either to die or to have our prayers beard Something   sorrow if not joy   we will get from thee Frode will be better pleased to hear of our slaughter than of our repulse
3,null,null,Without another word
4,null,null,he threatened to aim a blow at the king 's throat with his sword The king replied that it was unseemly for the royal majesty to meet an inferior in rank in level combat
5,null,null,and unfit that those of unequal station should fight as equals .

 (9, 9),(11, 9),

12,null,null,the top of the rail about thirty-three inches from the deck
13,null,null,The two bodies struck the rail with a heavy thud
14,null,null,instantly toppling overboard
15,null,null,That broke the spell that bound everybody
16,null,null,so that there was an instantaneous rush to the side
17,null,null,Only a hardly noticeable ripple remained on the surface of the placid sea .
1890 21
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Next he attacked and killed Hather in Jutland
2,null,null,and his fall is marked by the lasting name of the town
3,null,null,After this he overthrew Hunding and Rorik
4,null,null,seized Leire
5,null,null,and reunited the dismembered realm of Denmark into its original shape
6,null,null,Then he found that Asmund
7,null,null,the King of the Wikars
8,null,null,had been deprived of his throne by his elder sister
9,null,null,and
10,anger,angered,angered by such presumption on the part of a woman
11,null,null,went to Norway with a single ship
12,null,null,while the war was still undecided
13,null,null,to help him
14,null,null,The battle began
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,clothed in a purple cloak
17,null,null,with a coif broidered with gold
18,null,null,and with his hair bound up
19,null,null,he went against the enemy trusting not in arms
20,null,null,but in his silent certainty of his luck
21,null,null,in so much that he seemed dressed more for a feast than a fray .
1891 11
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Then Thorkill
2,null,null,seeing that they were of two minds
3,null,null,dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement
4,null,null,counselling them
5,null,null,to restrain themselves
6,null,null,and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter
7,happiness,delightful,albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold
8,null,null,to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear
9,null,null,neither to desire what was pleasant to take
10,null,null,nor dread what was awful to look upon
11,null,null,though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things .
1892 5
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Ragnar showed on this occasion the most merciful moderation towards the slayer of his dearest son
2,happiness,satisfied,since he sufficiently satisfied the vengeance which he desired
3,null,null,by the exile of the culprit rather than his death
4,null,null,This compassion shamed the Russians out of any further age against such a king
5,null,null,who could not be driven even by the most grievous wrongs to inflict death upon his prisoners .
1893 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Thus SIWARD
2,null,null,by the sovereign vote of the whole Danish assembly
3,null,null,received the empire of his father
4,happiness,satisfied,But after the defeats he had inflicted everywhere he was satisfied with the honour he received at home
5,null,null,and liked better to be famous with the gown than with the sword .
1894 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness
2,null,null,and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house
3,sadness,sorrow,But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar
4,null,null,who had been expelled from the kingdom
5,null,null,For the Gauls had made him fly
6,null,null,and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella
7,null,null,the son of Hame .
1895 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,We spent ten happy days in Honolulu
2,null,null,marred only by one or two drunken rows among the chaps forward
3,null,null,which
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
6,null,null,where good order was now kept
7,null,null,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
8,happiness,glad,which I was glad to see
9,null,null,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago
10,null,null,Being short-handed
11,null,null,the captain engaged a number of friendly islanders for a limited period
12,null,null,on the understanding that they were to be discharged at their native place
13,null,null,Vau Vau .
1896 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Poor lady
2,null,null,she never knew how sore that boy 's feet had been
3,null,null,nor how many times he had gone with half a meal or none at all
4,fear,fear,for fear of depleting too much the small store she had given him when he left home .
1897 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,to prevent any more troublesome business delaying his hopes of marriage
3,happiness,enjoyed,he went back to Gewar and enjoyed the coveted embraces of Nanna
4,null,null,Next
5,null,null,having treated Helgi and Thora very generously
6,null,null,he brought his new queen back to Sweden
7,null,null,being as much honoured by all for his victory as Balder was laughed at for his flight .
1898 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,But Odin
2,null,null,who had found that nothing served the wishes of lovers more than tough persistency
3,disgust,shame,though he was stung with the shame of his double rebuff
4,null,null,nevertheless
5,null,null,effacing the form he had worn before
6,null,null,went to the king for the third time
7,null,null,professing the most complete skill in soldier ship .
1899 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,So he besought them to make his son RORIK king
2,null,null,so that the judgment of wicked men should not transfer the royalty to strange and unknown houses
3,happiness,joy,asserting that he would reap more joy from the succession of his son than bitterness from his own impending death
4,null,null,This request was speedily granted .
1900 7
 (4, 4),(4, 5),
1,null,null,Drawing him by those appeals
2,null,null,and warily noting the right spot to plant his blow
3,null,null,he turned the other edge of his sword to the front
4,fear,fearing,fearing that the thin side of his blade was too frail for his strength
5,null,null,and smote with a piercing stroke through the prince 's body
6,null,null,When Wermund heard it
7,null,null,he said that the sound of his sword  "  Skrep "   had reached his ear for the second time .
1901 11
 (3, 3),(3, 6),
1,null,null,He had several times taken caravans to Karague
2,null,null,and knew all the languages well
3,sadness,unfortunately,but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied
4,null,null,That
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,I could not foresee
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,trusting to him and good-luck
9,null,null,I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters
10,null,null,but they came and went in the most tantalising manner
11,null,null,notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give .
1902 15
 (8, 9),
1,null,null,This night one was shot
2,null,null,without any mistake about it
3,null,null,for the next morning we tracked him by his blood
4,null,null,and afterwards heard he had died of his wound
5,null,null,The Wasui elders
6,null,null,contrary to my expectation
7,null,null,then came and congratulated us on our success
8,happiness,wonderful,They thought us most wonderful men
9,null,null,and possessed of supernatural powers
10,null,null,for the thief in question was a magician
11,null,null,who until now was thought to be invulnerable
12,null,null,Indeed
13,null,null,they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people
14,null,null,but though they had so many more guns than ourselves
15,null,null,they never succeeded in killing one .
1903 10
 (3, 4),(3, 5),
1,null,null,At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side
2,null,null,when
3,surprise,surprise,to surprise me
4,null,null,the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us
5,null,null,They had gone out of the lake at its northern end
6,null,null,paddled into
7,null,null,and then up the Kagera to where we stood
8,null,null,showing
9,null,null,by actual navigation
10,null,null,the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon .
1904 5
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu ( men eaters )
2,null,null,who disdained all food but human flesh
3,null,null,and Rumanika confirmed the statement
4,disgust,sceptical,Though I felt very sceptical  about it
5,null,null,I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick 's Nyam Nyams ( men eaters ) .
1905 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .
1906 8
 (5, 1),(5, 4),
1,null,null,This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight
2,null,null,for my cows were eaten up
3,null,null,and my men clamouring incessantly for food
4,null,null,and though they might by orders help themselves  "  ku n'yangania "   by seizing from the Waganda
5,sadness,hurt,it hurt my feelings so much to witness this
6,null,null,that I tried from the first to dispense with it
7,null,null,telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing
8,null,null,and now he turned them into a pack of thieves .
1907 33
 (16, 2),
1,null,null,About a year later
2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person
10,null,null,not obstreperously so
11,null,null,but quietly and under the surface

30,null,null,there being no desire on anybody 's part to contest her right to all the property
31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house

1,null,null,It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars

3,null,null,and he knew exactly what to do with it

1,null,null,Either the well was very deep
2,null,null,or she fell very slowly
3,null,null,for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next  .  First
4,null,null,she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to
5,null,null,but it was too dark to see anything
6,null,null,then she looked at the sides of the well
7,null,null,and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves
8,null,null,here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  .  She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed
9,null,null,it was labelled ' ORANGE MARMALADE '
10,surprise,to her great disappointment,but to her great disappointment it was empty :  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody

13,null,null,after such a fall as this
14,null,null,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
15,null,null,How brave they 'll all think me at home

 (4, 4),
1,null,null,And so it was indeed :  she was now only ten inches high
2,null,null,and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First
3,null,null,however
4,fear,nervous,she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further :  she felt a little nervous about this
5,null,null,for it might end
6,null,null,you know
7,null,null,' said Alice to herself
8,null,null,in my going out altogether
9,null,null,like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then
10,null,null,' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out
11,null,null,for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
1915 22
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table :  she opened it
2,null,null,and found in it a very small cake
3,null,null,on which the words  ' EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants Well
4,null,null,i 'll eat it
5,null,null,' said Alice
6,null,null,and if it makes me grow larger
7,null,null,I can reach the key
8,null,null,and if it makes me grow smaller
9,null,null,I can creep under the door
10,null,null,so either way i 'll get into the garden
11,null,null,and I dont care which happens
12,null,null,' She ate a little bit
13,null,null,and said anxiously to herself
14,null,null,Which way
15,null,null,Which way
16,null,null,holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing
17,surprise,quite surprised,and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size :  to be sure
18,null,null,this generally happens when one eats cake
19,null,null,but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen
20,null,null,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
21,null,null,she set to work
22,null,null,and very soon finished off the cake .

1,null,null,Suddenly
2,null,null,a ferocious looking beast sprang out of the bush

5,null,null,whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity
6,null,null,The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters
7,null,null,He tried to trust to his father 's promise
8,fear,terror,but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm
9,null,null,for every moment the wind grew fiercer
10,null,null,and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity .
1923 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,While Hubert had been in the  "  Trap
2,null,null,"   his father and uncle had been walking along the beach
3,null,null,and the former heard for the first time the nature and danger of the  "  Smuggler 's Trap
4,null,null,He was at once filled with anxiety about his son
5,null,null,and had hurried to the place to call him back
6,fear,horror,when to his horror he found that the tide had already covered the only way by which the dangerous place might be approached .
1924 5
 (2, 1),(4, 1),
1,null,null,"  He should not have done so under any circumstances
2,anger,sternly,"   said his father sternly
3,null,null,to himself
4,anger,shocked,"  I am both surprised and shocked
5,null,null,and the punishment must be severe .  "
1925 5
 (2, 1),(4, 1),
1,null,null,"  He should not have done so under any circumstances
2,anger,sternly,"   said his father sternly
3,null,null,to himself
4,anger,surprised,"  I am both surprised and shocked
5,null,null,and the punishment must be severe .  "
1926 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Let me say
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,as briefly as possible
4,null,null,that I accompanied the engineer into the interior of the mine
5,happiness,fascinated,and became so strangely fascinated by its gloomy wonders
6,null,null,and so interested in my friend 's explorations
7,null,null,that I prolonged my stay in the neighbourhood .
1927 7
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,As I drew nearer and nearer to the light
2,null,null,the chasm became wider
3,null,null,and at last I saw
4,surprise,amaze,to my unspeakable amaze
5,null,null,a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss and illumined as far as the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas lamps placed at regular intervals
6,null,null,as in the thoroughfare of a great city
7,null,null,and I heard confusedly at a distance a hum as of human voices .
1928 13
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,When the cage stopped
2,null,null,I found myself on a ridge of rock
3,null,null,and below me
4,null,null,the chasm
5,null,null,taking a slanting direction
6,null,null,shot down to a considerable depth
7,null,null,the darkness of which my lamp could not have penetrated
8,null,null,But through it
9,happiness,surprise,to my infinite surprise
10,null,null,streamed upward a steady brilliant light
11,null,null,Could it be any volcanic fire
12,null,null,In that case
13,null,null,surely I should have felt the heat .
1929 4
 (1, 2),
1,sadness,horror,While I was bending over his corpse in grief and horror
2,null,null,I heard close at hand a strange sound between a snort and a hiss
3,null,null,and turning instinctively to the quarter from which it came
4,null,null,I saw emerging from a dark fissure in the rock a vast and terrible head
1930 22
 (12, 10),
1,null,null,Little Sam
2,null,null,however
3,null,null,was not yet ready to enjoy the island and the cave
4,null,null,He was still delicate the least promising of the family
5,null,null,He was queer and fanciful
6,null,null,and rather silent
7,null,null,He walked in his sleep and was often found in the middle of the night
8,null,null,fretting with the cold
9,null,null,in some dark corner
10,null,null,Once he heard that a neighbor 's children had the measles
11,null,null,and
12,fear,very anxious,being very anxious to catch the complaint
13,null,null,slipped over to the house and crept into bed with an infected playmate
14,null,null,Some days later
15,null,null,Little Sam 's relatives gathered about his bed to see him die
16,null,null,He confessed
17,null,null,long after
18,null,null,that the scene gratified him
19,null,null,However
20,null,null,he survived
21,null,null,and fell into the habit of running away
22,null,null,usually in the direction of the river .
1931 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,In Tom Sawyer
2,null,null,Indian Joe dies in the cave
3,null,null,He did not die there in real life
4,null,null,but was lost there once and was very weak when they found him
5,null,null,He was not as bad as painted in the book
6,null,null,though he was dissolute and accounted dangerous
7,null,null,and when one night he died in reality
8,fear,so terrific,there came a thunderstorm so terrific that Sam Clemens at home
9,null,null,in bed
10,null,null,was certain that Satan had come in person for the half-breed 's soul
11,null,null,He covered his head and said his prayers with fearful anxiety lest the evil one might decide to save another trip by taking him along then .
1932 10
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,All conversation was kept between the two queens
2,null,null,but her Wichwezi majesty had a platter of clay stone brought
3,null,null,which she ate with great relish
4,null,null,making a noise of satisfaction like a happy guinea pig
5,null,null,She threw me a bit
6,surprise,surprise,which to the surprise of everybody
7,null,null,I caught and threw it into my mouth
8,null,null,thinking it was some confection
9,null,null,but the harsh taste soon made me spit it out again
10,null,null,to the amusement of the company .
1933 13
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,the king
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,observing my men who had gone to Unyoro together with Kamrasi 's
4,null,null,questioned them on their mission
5,null,null,and when told that no white men were there
6,anger,wrathful,he waxed wrathful
7,null,null,and said it was a falsehood
8,null,null,for his men had seen them
9,null,null,and could not be mistaken
10,null,null,Kamrasi
11,null,null,he said
12,null,null,must have hidden them somewhere
13,null,null,fearful of the number of guns which now surrounded him
1934 7
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,I sent Bombay with the compass
2,happiness,delight,much to the delight of the king
3,null,null,who no sooner saw it than he jumped and woh wohed with intense excitement at the treasure he had gained
4,null,null,said it was the greatest present Bana had ever given him
5,null,null,for it was the thing by which he found out all the roads and countries it was
6,null,null,in fact
7,null,null,half his knowledge
1935 16
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,I drew a large white and black hornbill and a green pigeon sent by himself
2,sadness,not satisfied,but he was not satisfied
3,null,null,he sent more birds
4,null,null,and wanted to see my shoes
5,null,null,The pages who came with the second message
6,null,null,however
7,null,null,proving impertinent
8,null,null,got a book flung at their heads
9,null,null,and a warning to be off
10,null,null,as I intended to see the king myself
11,null,null,and ask for food to keep my ever complaining Wanguana quiet
12,null,null,Proceeding to the palace
13,null,null,as I found Mtesa had gone out shooting
14,null,null,I called on the Kamraviona
15,null,null,complained that my camp was starving
16,null,null,and as I had nothing left to give the king said I wished to leave the country .
1936 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,It was the window of a jeweller whose diamonds and  sapphires seemed to laugh
2,null,null,in flashes like high notes of sound
3,happiness,joy,with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were  "  worth "   than  most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side  of the pane
4,null,null,Stransom lingered long enough to suspend
5,null,null,in a  vision
6,null,null,a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim
7,null,null,and  then was kept an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew .
1937 6
 (1, 2),(1, 3),
1,happiness,determined,He felt quite determined
2,null,null,as he walked away
3,null,null,never in his life to go near her
4,null,null,She was perhaps a human being
5,null,null,but Creston ought n't  to have shown her without precautions
6,null,null,ought n't indeed to have  shown her at all .
1938 7
 (3, 6),
1,null,null,It wasnt that they could show him anything
2,null,null,it was  only that they could burn clear
3,surprise,surprise,To his surprise
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,after a  while
6,null,null,they did show him something :   the arch of a high doorway  approached by a low terrace of steps
7,null,null,in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end .
1939 7
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,He extracted from her at any rate an intimation that she should now  have means less limited
2,null,null,that her aunt 's tiny fortune had come to  her
3,null,null,so that there was henceforth only one to consume what had  formerly been made to suffice for two
4,happiness,joy,This was a joy to Stransom
5,null,null,because it had hitherto been equally impossible for him either to  offer her presents or contentedly to stay his hand
6,null,null,It was too  ugly to be at her side that way
7,null,null,abounding himself and yet not able  to overflow - a demonstration that would have been signally a false  note .
1940 16
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,The children paused for a moment and glanced at each other
2,null,null,wondering which one of them was going to commit to an answer

5,null,null,' said Gretel eventually
6,null,null,' i would n't mind having some friends again
7,null,null,Bruno smiled

16,null,null,' said Gretel in a determined voice .
1942 14
 (13, 14),
1,null,null,Bruno thought about it
2,null,null,' well
3,null,null,I would n't like it if you were n't there
4,null,null,' he said
5,null,null,because that was the truth
6,null,null,' so you 'd prefer to stay here with me
7,null,null,i 'd prefer all four of us to stay together
8,null,null,' he said
9,null,null,reluctantly including Gretel in that
10,null,null,' whether that was in Berlin or out with
11,null,null,' oh
12,null,null,Bruno
13,anger,exasperated,' said Gretel in an exasperated voice
14,null,null,and he didnt know whether that was because he might be spoiling the plans for their return or because ( according to her ) he continued to mispronounce the name of their home .
1943 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,' what do you mean there are hundreds of children over there
2,null,null,' asked Father
3,null,null,' what do you know of what goes on over there
4,fear,worried,' Bruno opened his mouth to speak but worried that he would get himself into trouble if he revealed too much
5,null,null,' i can see them from my bedroom window
6,null,null,' he said finally
7,null,null,' theyre very far away of course
8,null,null,but it looks like there are hundreds
9,null,null,All wearing the striped pyjamas . '

 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
2,null,null,others sprang into the sea
3,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
4,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
5,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
6,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
7,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
8,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
9,null,null,now beaten this way
10,null,null,now that
11,sadness,despaired,and when night fell I despaired for my life
12,null,null,but
13,null,null,weary and spent as I was
14,null,null,I clung to my frail support
15,null,null,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island .
1945 7
 (6, 5),
1,null,null,The prince could hardly believe his ears
2,null,null,and rode off as hard as he could
3,null,null,He found his way

5,null,null,where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grand vizir 's carelessness

7,null,null,and had him strangled immediately .

4,null,null,Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and would come too
5,null,null,I could not help thinking they might as well give a party at my house while they are about it
6,null,null,However
7,null,null,as Carrie sensibly said :    "  Do anything

3,null,null,Had it not been for the fact that it would be the last chance for him and Shmuel to spend any time together not to mention the fact that the adventure would be a very exciting one
4,null,null,especially since it involved dressing up he would have given up on it for the day and waited until some afternoon the following week
5,null,null,when he didnt have anything special planned .
1960 15
 (15, 3),
1,null,null,' hello

 (10, 10),
1,null,null,A barrow full of WHAT
2,null,null,' thought Alice
3,null,null,but she had not long to doubt
4,null,null,for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window
5,null,null,and some of them hit her in the face i 'll put a stop to this
6,null,null,' she said to herself
7,null,null,and shouted out
8,null,null,you 'd better not do that again
9,null,null,' which produced another dead silence
10,surprise,with some surprise,Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor
11,null,null,and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes
12,null,null,' she thought
13,null,null,it 's sure to make SOME change in my size
14,null,null,and as it cant possibly make me larger
15,null,null,it must make me smaller
16,null,null,I suppose . '
2053 30
 (7, 8),
1,null,null,An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes
2,null,null,and feebly stretching out one paw
3,null,null,trying to touch her Poor little thing
4,null,null,' said Alice
5,null,null,in a coaxing tone
6,null,null,and she tried hard to whistle to it
7,fear,frightened,but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
8,null,null,in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did
9,null,null,she picked up a little bit of stick
10,null,null,and held it out to the puppy
11,null,null,whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
12,null,null,with a yelp of delight
13,null,null,and rushed at the stick
14,null,null,and made believe to worry it
15,null,null,then Alice dodged behind a great thistle
16,null,null,to keep herself from being run over
17,null,null,and the moment she appeared on the other side
18,null,null,the puppy made another rush at the stick
19,null,null,and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
20,null,null,then Alice
21,null,null,thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse
22,null,null,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet
23,null,null,ran round the thistle again
24,null,null,then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
25,null,null,running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
26,null,null,and barking hoarsely all the while
27,null,null,till at last it sat down a good way off
28,null,null,panting
29,null,null,with its tongue hanging out of its mouth
30,null,null,and its great eyes half shut .
2054 24
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,perhaps you have n't found it so yet
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day
5,null,null,you know and then after that into a butterfly
6,null,null,I should think youll feel it a little queer
7,null,null,wont you
8,null,null,' Not a bit
9,null,null,' said the Caterpillar Well
10,null,null,perhaps your feelings may be different
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,all I know is
13,null,null,it would feel very queer to ME
14,null,null,You
15,null,null,' said the Caterpillar contemptuously Who are YOU
16,null,null,' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
17,anger,felt a little irritated,ice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar 's making such VERY short remarks
18,null,null,and she drew herself up and said
19,null,null,very gravely
20,null,null,I think
21,null,null,you ought to tell me who YOU are
22,null,null,first
23,null,null,Why
24,null,null,' said the Caterpillar .
2055 37
 (18, 18),
1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,i 've tried to say  "  HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE
3,null,null,"   but it all came different
4,null,null,' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice
5,null,null,repeat
6,null,null,"  YOU ARE OLD
7,null,null,FATHER WILLIAM
8,null,null,"  ' said the Caterpillar  .  Alice folded her hands
9,null,null,and began :  You are old
10,null,null,Father William
11,null,null,' the young man said
12,null,null,And your hair has become very white
13,null,null,And yet you incessantly stand on your head  Do you think
14,null,null,at your age
15,null,null,it is right
16,null,null,'  In my youth
17,null,null,' Father William replied to his son
18,fear,feared,I feared it might injure the brain
19,null,null,But
20,null,null,now that im perfectly sure I have none
21,null,null,Why
22,null,null,I do it again and again
23,null,null,You are old
24,null,null,' said the youth
25,null,null,as I mentioned before
26,null,null,And have grown most uncommonly fat
27,null,null,Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door  Pray
28,null,null,what is the reason of that
29,null,null,'  In my youth
30,null,null,' said the sage
31,null,null,as he shook his grey locks
32,null,null,I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box  Allow me to sell you a couple
33,null,null,'  You are old
34,null,null,' said the youth
35,null,null,and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet
36,null,null,Yet you finished the goose
37,null,null,with the bones and the beak  Pray how did you manage to do it
2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,null,null,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,null,null,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,null,null,and as it was perfectly round
4,null,null,she found this a very difficult question  .  However
5,null,null,at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
6,null,null,and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
7,null,null,nd now which is which
8,null,null,' she said to herself
9,null,null,and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect :  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin :  it had struck her foot
10,fear,a good deal frightened,She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
11,null,null,but she felt that there was no time to be lost
12,null,null,as she was shrinking rapidly
13,null,null,so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot
14,null,null,that there was hardly room to open her mouth
15,null,null,but she did it at last
16,null,null,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come
17,null,null,my head 's free at last
18,null,null,' said Alice in a tone of delight
19,null,null,which changed into alarm in another moment
20,null,null,when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found :  all she could see
21,null,null,when she looked down
22,null,null,was an immense length of neck
23,null,null,which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
2057 37
 (24, 23),
1,null,null,Let me alone
2,null,null,'  Serpent
3,null,null,I say again
4,null,null,' repeated the Pigeon
5,null,null,but in a more subdued tone
6,null,null,and added with a kind of sob
7,null,null,i 've tried every way
8,null,null,and nothing seems to suit them
9,null,null,'  I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about
10,null,null,' said Alice
11,null,null,'ve tried the roots of trees
12,null,null,and i 've tried banks
13,null,null,and i 've tried hedges
14,null,null,' the Pigeon went on
15,null,null,without attending to her
16,null,null,but those serpents
17,null,null,There 's no pleasing them
18,null,null,' Alice was more and more puzzled
19,null,null,but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs
20,null,null,' said the Pigeon
21,null,null,but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day
22,null,null,Why
23,null,null,I have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
24,disgust,annoyed,' im very sorry you 've been annoyed
25,null,null,' said Alice
26,null,null,who was beginning to see its meaning And just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood
27,null,null,' continued the Pigeon
28,null,null,raising its voice to a shriek
29,null,null,and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last
30,null,null,they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
31,null,null,Ugh
32,null,null,Serpent
33,null,null,'  But im NOT a serpent
34,null,null,I tell you
35,null,null,' said Alice im a im a '  Well
36,null,null,WHAT are you
37,null,null,' said the Pigeon
2058 20
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,While she was trying to fix on one
2,null,null,the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire
3,null,null,and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby  the fire irons came first
4,null,null,then followed a shower of saucepans
5,null,null,plates
6,null,null,and dishes  .  The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her
7,null,null,and the baby was howling so much already
8,null,null,that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
9,null,null,PLEASE mind what you 're doing
10,null,null,' cried Alice
11,null,null,jumping up and down in an agony of terror Oh
12,null,null,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
13,null,null,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
14,null,null,and very nearly carried it off
15,null,null,f everybody minded their own business
16,null,null,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
17,null,null,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
18,null,null,Which would NOT be an advantage
19,null,null,' said Alice
20,happiness,glad,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
2059 29
 (14, 13),
1,null,null,Oh
2,null,null,there goes his PRECIOUS nose '
3,null,null,as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it
4,null,null,and very nearly carried it off
5,null,null,f everybody minded their own business
6,null,null,' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl
7,null,null,the world would go round a deal faster than it does
8,null,null,Which would NOT be an advantage
9,null,null,' said Alice
10,null,null,who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night
11,null,null,You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis ' Talking of axes
12,null,null,' said the Duchess
13,null,null,chop off her head
14,fear,anxiously,' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook
15,null,null,to see if she meant to take the hint
16,null,null,but the cook was busily stirring the soup
17,null,null,and seemed not to be listening
18,null,null,so she went on again :   Twenty-four hours
19,null,null,I THINK
20,null,null,or is it twelve
21,null,null,I ' Oh
22,null,null,dont bother ME
23,null,null,' said the Duchess
24,null,null,I never could abide figures
25,null,null,' And with that she began nursing her child again
26,null,null,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so
27,null,null,and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :   Speak roughly to your little boy
28,null,null,And beat him when he sneezes :  He only does it to annoy
29,null,null,Because he knows it teases . '
2060 18
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I dont quite understand you
2,null,null,' she said
3,null,null,as politely as she could The Dormouse is asleep again
4,null,null,' said the Hatter
5,disgust,impatiently,and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  .  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently
6,null,null,and said
7,null,null,without opening its eyes
8,null,null,Of course
9,null,null,of course
10,null,null,just what I was going to remark myself
11,null,null,Have you guessed the riddle yet
12,null,null,' the Hatter said
13,null,null,turning to Alice again No
14,null,null,I give it up
15,null,null,' Alice replied :   what 's the answer
16,null,null,'  I have n't the slightest idea
17,null,null,' said the Hatter Nor I
18,null,null,' said the March Hare
2061 31
 (20, 12),(20, 13),(20, 18),
1,null,null,Would you tell me
2,null,null,' said Alice
3,null,null,a little timidly
4,null,null,why you are painting those roses
5,null,null,' Five and Seven said nothing
6,null,null,but looked at Two  .  Two began in a low voice
7,null,null,Why the fact is
8,null,null,you see
9,null,null,Miss
10,null,null,this here ought to have been a RED rose tree
11,null,null,and we put a white one in by mistake
12,null,null,and if the Queen was to find it out
13,null,null,we should all have our heads cut off
14,null,null,you know
15,null,null,you see
16,null,null,Miss
17,null,null,we 're doing our best
18,null,null,afore she comes
19,null,null,to ' At this moment Five
20,fear,anxiously,who had been anxiously looking across the garden
21,null,null,called out  The Queen
22,null,null,The Queen
23,null,null,' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  .  There was a sound of many footsteps
24,null,null,and Alice looked round
25,null,null,eager to see the Queen  .  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs
26,null,null,these were all shaped like the three gardeners
27,null,null,oblong and flat
28,null,null,with their hands and feet at the corners :  next the ten courtiers
29,null,null,these were ornamented all over with diamonds
30,null,null,and walked two and two
31,null,null,as the soldiers did
2062 41
 (29, 29),
1,null,null,Idiot
2,null,null,' said the Queen
3,null,null,tossing her head impatiently
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,turning to Alice
6,null,null,she went on
7,null,null,What 's your name
8,null,null,child
9,null,null,'  My name is Alice
10,null,null,so please your Majesty
11,null,null,' said Alice very politely
12,null,null,but she added
13,null,null,to herself
14,null,null,Why
15,null,null,theyre only a pack of cards
16,null,null,after allI need n't be afraid of them
17,null,null,'  And who are THESE
18,null,null,' said the Queen
19,null,null,pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree
20,null,null,for
21,null,null,you see
22,null,null,as they were lying on their faces
23,null,null,and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack
24,null,null,she could not tell whether they were gardeners
25,null,null,or soldiers
26,null,null,or courtiers
27,null,null,or three of her own children How should I know
28,null,null,' said Alice
29,surprise,surprised,surprised at her own courage It 's no business of MINE
30,null,null,The Queen turned crimson with fury
31,null,null,and
32,null,null,after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast
33,null,null,screamed  Off with her head
34,null,null,Off '  Nonsense
35,null,null,' said Alice
36,null,null,very loudly and decidedly
37,null,null,and the Queen was silent  .  The King laid his hand upon her arm
38,null,null,and timidly said  Consider
39,null,null,my dear :  she is only a child
40,null,null,' The Queen turned angrily away from him
41,null,null,and said to the Knave  Turn them over
2063 18
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I said  "  What for
2,null,null,"  '  She boxed the Queen 's ears ' the Rabbit began . Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh
3,null,null,hush
4,fear,frightened,' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you
5,null,null,You see
6,null,null,she came rather late
7,null,null,and the Queen said '  Get to your places
8,null,null,' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
9,null,null,and people began running about in all directions
10,null,null,tumbling up against each other
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,they got settled down in a minute or two
13,null,null,and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life
14,null,null,it was all ridges and furrows
15,null,null,the balls were live hedgehogs
16,null,null,the mallets live flamingoes
17,null,null,and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet
18,null,null,to make the arches
2064 19
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
2,null,null,the fight was over
3,null,null,and both the hedgehogs were out of sight :   but it does n't matter much
4,null,null,' thought Alice
5,null,null,as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
6,null,null,So she tucked it away under her arm
7,null,null,that it might not escape again
8,null,null,and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  .  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat
9,surprise,surprised,she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it :  there was a dispute going on between the executioner
10,null,null,the King
11,null,null,and the Queen
12,null,null,who were all talking at once
13,null,null,while all the rest were quite silent
14,null,null,and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared
15,null,null,she was appealed to by all three to settle the question
16,null,null,and they repeated their arguments to her
17,null,null,though
18,null,null,as they all spoke at once
19,null,null,she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
2065 18
 (9, 10),(9, 13),
1,null,null,Thinking again
2,null,null,' the Duchess asked
3,null,null,with another dig of her sharp little chin i 've a right to think
4,null,null,' said Alice sharply
5,null,null,for she was beginning to feel a little worried Just about as much right
6,null,null,' said the Duchess
7,null,null,as pigs have to fly
8,null,null,and the m ' But here
9,surprise,to Alice 's great surprise,to Alice 's great surprise
10,null,null,the Duchess 's voice died away
11,null,null,even in the middle of her favourite word  moral
12,null,null,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up
13,null,null,and there stood the Queen in front of them
14,null,null,with her arms folded
15,null,null,frowning like a thunderstorm A fine day
16,null,null,your Majesty
17,null,null,' the Duchess began in a low
18,null,null,weak voice
2066 19
 (14, 8),(14, 9),
1,null,null,A fine day
2,null,null,your Majesty
3,null,null,' the Duchess began in a low
4,null,null,weak voice Now
5,null,null,I give you fair warning
6,null,null,' shouted the Queen
7,null,null,stamping on the ground as she spoke
8,null,null,either you or your head must be off
9,null,null,and that in about half no time
10,null,null,Take your choice
11,null,null,' The Duchess took her choice
12,null,null,and was gone in a moment Let 's go on with the game
13,null,null,' the Queen said to Alice
14,fear,frightened,and Alice was too much frightened to say a word
15,null,null,but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground . The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen 's absence
16,null,null,and were resting in the shade :  however
17,null,null,the moment they saw her
18,null,null,they hurried back to the game
19,null,null,the Queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives
2067 24
 (16, 16),
1,null,null,I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is
2,null,null,It 's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from
3,null,null,' said the Queen I never saw one
4,null,null,or heard of one
5,null,null,' said Alice Come on
6,null,null,then
7,null,null,' said the Queen
8,null,null,and he shall tell you his history
9,null,null,' As they walked off together
10,null,null,Alice heard the King say in a low voice
11,null,null,to the company generally
12,null,null,You are all pardoned
13,null,null,Come
14,null,null,THAT 's a good thing
15,null,null,' she said to herself
16,sadness,unhappy,for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered
17,null,null,ey very soon came upon a Gryphon
18,null,null,lying fast asleep in the sun ( IF you dont know what a Gryphon is
19,null,null,look at the picture
20,null,null,Up
21,null,null,lazy thing
22,null,null,' said the Queen
23,null,null,and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle
24,null,null,and to hear his history
2068 20
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,When we were little
2,null,null,' the Mock Turtle went on at last
3,null,null,more calmly
4,null,null,though still sobbing a little now and then
5,null,null,we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise '  Why did you call him Tortoise
6,null,null,if he wasnt one
7,null,null,' Alice asked We called him Tortoise because he taught us
8,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle angrily :   really you are very dull
9,sadness,ashamed,'  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
10,null,null,' added the Gryphon
11,null,null,and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice
12,null,null,who felt ready to sink into the earth . At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle
13,null,null,Drive on
14,null,null,old fellow
15,null,null,dont be all day about it
16,null,null,' and he went on in these words :   Yes
17,null,null,we went to school in the sea
18,null,null,though you may n't believe it '  I never said I didnt
19,null,null,' interrupted Alice You did
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle
2069 26
 (19, 17),
1,null,null,theyre done with blacking
2,null,null,I believe
3,null,null,Boots and shoes under the sea
4,null,null,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice
5,null,null,are done with a whiting . Now you know
6,null,null,And what are they made of
7,null,null,' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity Soles and eels
8,null,null,of course
9,null,null,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently :   any shrimp could have told you that
10,null,null,If i 'd been the whiting
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,whose thoughts were still running on the song
13,null,null,i 'd have said to the porpoise
14,null,null,"  Keep back
15,null,null,please :  we dont want YOU with us
16,null,null,"  '  They were obliged to have him with them
17,null,null,' the Mock Turtle said :   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
18,null,null,would n't it really
19,surprise,in a tone of great surprise,' said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle :   why
21,null,null,if a fish came to ME
22,null,null,and told me he was going a journey
23,null,null,I should say  "  With what porpoise
24,null,null,"  '  dont you mean  "  purpose "
25,null,null,' said Alice I mean what I say
26,null,null,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone
2070 23
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,And the Gryphon added  Come
2,null,null,let 's hear some of YOUR adventures
3,null,null,I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
4,null,null,' said Alice a little timidly :   but it 's no use going back to yesterday
5,null,null,because I was a different person then
6,null,null,Explain all that
7,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle No
8,null,null,no
9,null,null,The adventures first
10,null,null,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone :   explanations take such a dreadful time
11,fear,nervous,So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first
12,null,null,the two creatures got so close to her
13,null,null,one on each side
14,null,null,and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide
15,null,null,but she gained courage as she went on . Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  YOU ARE OLD
16,null,null,FATHER WILLIAM
17,null,null,' to the Caterpillar
18,null,null,and the words all coming different
19,null,null,and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath
20,null,null,and said  That 's very curious
21,null,null,It 's all about as curious as it can be
22,null,null,' said the Gryphon It all came different
23,null,null,' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully
2071 28
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Off with her head
2,null,null,' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved Who cares for you
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,( she had grown to her full size by this time
5,null,null,you 're nothing but a pack of cards
6,null,null,' At this the whole pack rose up into the air
7,null,null,and came flying down upon her :  she gave a little scream
8,fear,half of fright and half of anger,half of fright and half of anger
9,null,null,and tried to beat them off
10,null,null,and found herself lying on the bank
11,null,null,with her head in the lap of her sister
12,null,null,who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up
13,null,null,Alice dear
14,null,null,' said her sister
15,null,null,Why
16,null,null,what a long sleep you 've had
17,null,null,'  Oh
18,null,null,i 've had such a curious dream
19,null,null,' said Alice
20,null,null,and she told her sister
21,null,null,as well as she could remember them
22,null,null,all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
23,null,null,and when she had finished
24,null,null,her sister kissed her
25,null,null,and said
26,null,null,It WAS a curious dream
27,null,null,dear
28,null,null,certainly :  but now run in to your tea
2072 5
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,' good Uncle
2,happiness,excitement,' cried the maiden in eager excitement
3,null,null,' there is a guest coming
4,null,null,He has just turned over the brae side
5,null,null,and can be coming nowhere but here . '
2073 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Patrick 's face cleared
2,fear,feared,It was no grace or beauty that he feared in any stranger
3,null,null,but the sheer might and un right that their Regency enabled the House of Albany to exercise over the orphans of the royal family
4,null,null,whose head was absent
5,null,null,and a captive knight could be no mischievous person
6,null,null,Still this might be only a specious pretence to impose on the chaplain
7,null,null,and gain admittance to the castle
8,null,null,and Patrick was resolved to be well on his guard
9,null,null,though he replied courteously to the graceful bow with which the stranger greeted him
10,null,null,saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent
11,null,null,' i have been bold enough to presume on the good father 's offer of hospitality
12,null,null,Sir . '
2074 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,' what should I see
2,null,null,Who is he like
3,null,null,' asked Patrick
4,surprise,surprised,surprised at his father 's manner .
2075 13
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Lilias sat between her uncle and his guest
2,disgust,jealousy,looking so fair and bright that Patrick felt fresh accesses of angry jealousy
3,null,null,while the visitor talked as one able to report to the natives from another world
4,null,null,and that world the hateful England
5,null,null,which as a Scotsman he was bound to abhor
6,null,null,Had it been France
7,null,null,it had been endurable
8,null,null,but praise of English habits was mere disloyalty
9,null,null,and yet
10,null,null,whenever Patrick tried to throw in a disparaging word
11,null,null,he found himself met with a quiet superiority such as he had believed no knight in Scotland could assume with him
12,null,null,and still it was neither brow beating nor insolence
13,null,null,nothing that could give offence .
2076 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Patrick shrugged his shoulders
2,fear,anxious,but Lilias was so anxious to hear the lay
3,null,null,that she entreated him to be silent
4,null,null,and Sir James
5,null,null,with a manly mellow voice
6,null,null,with an exceedingly sweet strain in it
7,null,null,and a skill
8,null,null,both of modulation and finger
9,null,null,such as showed admirable taste and instruction
10,null,null,poured forth that beautiful song of the nightingale at Windsor
11,null,null,which commences King James 's story of his love
12,null,null,in his poem of the King 's Quhair .
2077 23
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,There was an eager pressing round to hear
2,null,null,and not only were Lilias and Malcolm
3,null,null,but old Sir David himself
4,null,null,much affected by the strain
5,null,null,which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III
6,null,null,which
7,null,null,sad as they were
8,null,null,now seemed like good old times
9,null,null,so much worse was the present state of affairs
10,null,null,Sir James
11,null,null,however
12,fear,anxious,seemed anxious to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung
13,null,null,and applied to Malcolm to give a specimen of his powers :   and thus
14,null,null,with music
15,null,null,ballad
16,null,null,and lay
17,null,null,the evening passed away
18,null,null,till the parting cup was sent round
19,null,null,and the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment where he was to sleep
20,null,null,in a wainscoted box bedstead
21,null,null,and his two attendant squires
22,null,null,a great iron gray Scot and a rosy honest faced Englishman
23,null,null,on pallets on the floor .
2078 29
 (22, 22),
1,null,null,They were
2,null,null,in effect
3,null,null,riding somewhat carelessly
4,null,null,and with the ease of men whose feat was performed
5,null,null,and who expected no more opposition Full in the midst was Lilias
6,null,null,entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her
7,null,null,and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse
8,null,null,ridden by a slender
9,null,null,light limbed
10,null,null,wiry groom
11,null,null,whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall
12,null,null,a retainer of the Duke of Albany
13,null,null,and beside him rode her captor
14,null,null,Sir Walter Stewart
15,null,null,a man little above twenty
16,null,null,but with a bronzed
17,null,null,hardened
18,null,null,reckless expression that made him look much older
19,null,null,and of huge height and giant build . Malcolm knew him well
20,null,null,and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread
21,null,null,both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father
22,fear,fear,from fear of his intentions
23,null,null,and from the misery that his brutal jests
24,null,null,scoffs
25,null,null,and practical jokes had often personally inflicted :   and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst fears But ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror
26,null,null,Sir James 's shout of  ' st andrew for the right
27,null,null,' was ringing out
28,null,null,echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him
29,null,null,as simultaneously they leapt forward
2079 2
 (1, 1),
1,fear,anxiety,And for all Malcolm 's anxiety for his uncle
2,null,null,his heart had never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self respect .
2080 27
 (25, 26),(25, 27),
1,null,null,' kinsman
2,null,null,' thought Malcolm
3,null,null,' do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal
4,null,null,' but then
5,null,null,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,null,null,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,null,null,and so kind to himself
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,null,null,dismounted
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,as John said
13,null,null,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,null,null,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,null,null,sheltered from the wind
16,null,null,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,null,null,dried fish
18,null,null,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,null,null,in a bright warm sunshine
20,null,null,and Hal
21,null,null,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,null,null,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,null,null,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,null,null,seated himself on the grass
25,surprise,surprise,and to Malcolm 's extreme surprise
26,null,null,not to say disgust
27,null,null,was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap .
2081 13
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,He was glad that his own Sir James was equal in dignity
2,null,null,as well as superior in height
3,null,null,and he thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible to the sparkling azure eyes of the Englishman
4,null,null,steadfast
5,null,null,keen
6,null,null,and brilliant unspeakably though they were
7,null,null,but so soon as Sir James seemed to have made his explanation
8,null,null,the look was most winningly turned on him
9,null,null,a hand held out
10,null,null,and he was thus greeted :   ' welcome
11,null,null,my young Prince Malcolm
12,happiness,happy,I am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer
13,null,null,that he has brought you to partake it . '
2082 20
 (20, 19),
1,null,null,A courier rode up at the moment
2,null,null,and presented some letters
3,null,null,which Sir Harry at once opened and read
4,null,null,beckoning his brother and Sir James to his side
5,null,null,while Malcolm rode on in their wake
6,null,null,in a state of dismay and bewilderment
7,null,null,Nigel and Lord Marmion were together at so great an interval that he could not fall back on them
8,null,null,nor learn from them who these brothers were
9,null,null,And there was something in the ironical suppressed pity with which Harry had spoken of his prospects with the King of Scots
10,null,null,that terrified him all the more
11,null,null,because he knew that Sir James and Nigel would both hold it unworthy of him to have spoken freely of his own sovereign with an Englishman
12,null,null,Would James be another Walter
13,null,null,and
14,null,null,if so
15,null,null,would Sir James Stewart protect him
16,null,null,He had acquired much affection for
17,null,null,and strong reliance on
18,null,null,the knight
19,null,null,but there was something unexplained
20,sadness,hear sank,and his hear sank .
2083 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,' nay
2,null,null,an it were so at home
3,null,null,' said Baird
4,null,null,' i had as lief stay here as where a man is not free to fight out his own feud
5,disgust,shame,Even this sackless fellow thought it shame to see two honest men baulked . '
2084 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,' would Douglas but so fight in any good quarrel
2,null,null,' sighed the King
3,null,null,' but what are you longing to ask
4,null,null,Malcolm
5,null,null,Is it for your kinsman Patrick
6,fear,fear,I fear me that there is little chance of your hearing by name of him . '
2085 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Malcolm
2,null,null,ashamed to say he was royal
3,surprise,surprised,but surprised at the patronage
4,null,null,was gratefully following
5,null,null,when old Bairdsbrae indignantly laid his hand on the rein
6,null,null,' not so
7,null,null,Sir
8,null,null,this is no place for you

7,null,null,Sir
8,null,null,this is no place for you
2087 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The girl was as shy as a fawn
2,fear,frightened,frightened at every word from knight or lady
3,null,null,and much in awe of her future mother-in-law
4,null,null,a stiff and stately dame
5,null,null,with all the Beaufort haughtiness
6,null,null,so that Lady Westmoreland gladly and graciously consented to the offer of the Demoiselle de Luxemburg to attend to the little maiden
7,null,null,and let her share her chamber and her bed .
2088 21
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Malcolm felt as averse as did the French princesses to burgher wealth and splendour
2,null,null,and his mind had not opened to understand burgher worth and weight
3,null,null,and when he saw the princes John and Humfrey
4,null,null,and even his own king
5,null,null,seeking out city dames and accosting them with friendly looks
6,null,null,it seemed to him a degrading truckling to riches
7,fear,anxious,from which he was anxious to save his future queen
8,null,null,but when he would have offered his arm to Lady Joan
9,null,null,he saw her already being led away by an alderman measuring at least a yard across the shoulders
10,null,null,and the good natured Earl of March
11,null,null,seeing him at a loss
12,null,null,presented him to a round merry wife in a scarlet petticoat and black boddice
13,null,null,its plump curves wreathed with geld chains
14,null,null,who began pitying him for having been sent to the wars so young
15,null,null,being
16,null,null,as usual
17,null,null,charmed into pity by his soft appealing eyes and unconscious grace
18,null,null,would not believe his assertions that he was neither a captive nor a Frenchman
19,null,null,dont tell her
20,null,null,when he spoke like a stranger
21,null,null,and halted from a wound . '
2089 25
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,' lo you now
2,null,null,Sir Richard
3,null,null,' said Henry
4,null,null,with a playful face of disgust
5,null,null,' this is to save your dainty meats
6,null,null,by spoiling my appetite by that unwelcome sight
7,null,null,What
8,null,null,man
9,null,null,have you bought up all the bonds I gave in my need to a whole synagogue of Jews and bench of loin bards
10,null,null,I shall have to send for my crown before you let me go
11,null,null,though verily
12,null,null,' he added
13,null,null,with frank
14,null,null,open face
15,null,null,' im better off with a good friend like you for my creditor only im sorry for you
16,null,null,Sir Richard
17,fear,fear,I fear it will be long ere you see your good gold in the stead of your dirty paper
18,null,null,even though I gave you an order on the tolls

20,null,null,What
21,null,null,man

23,null,null,Art raving
24,null,null,Here
25,null,null,the tongs
2090 13
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Yet he was reluctant to break with the old habits that had hitherto been part of his nature
2,null,null,he felt
3,null,null,after every word of Esclairmonde nay
4,null,null,after every glance towards her as though it were a blessed thing to have
5,null,null,like her
6,null,null,chosen the better part
7,null,null,he knew she would approve his resort to the home of piety and learning
8,sadness,ashamed,he was aware that when with Ralf Percy and the other youths of the Court he was ashamed of his own scrupulousness
9,null,null,and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and unmanly
10,null,null,and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic might not seize him and disgrace him for ever
11,null,null,In effect he did not know what he wished
12,null,null,even when he found that the Queen had decided against going across the sea
13,null,null,and that therefore all the ladies would remain with her at Shene or Windsor .
2091 19
 (19, 19),
1,null,null,He had shot up suddenly to a fair height
2,null,null,had almost lost his lameness
3,null,null,and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue
4,null,null,His nerves had become less painfully sensitive
5,null,null,and when after his first skirmish
6,null,null,during which he had kept close to King James
7,null,null,far too much terrified to stir an inch from him
8,null,null,he had not only found himself perfectly safe
9,null,null,but had been much praised for his valour
10,null,null,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,what with use
13,null,null,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,null,null,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,null,null,Perhaps
16,null,null,indeed
17,null,null,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,null,null,in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward
19,fear,fear,and his fear lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such .

 (3, 3),
1,null,null,' ah
2,null,null,' said Henry
3,sadness,depressed,depressed by failing health
4,null,null,a sleepless night
5,null,null,and hungry morning
6,null,null,' maybe it were better for him
7,null,null,soul and body both
8,null,null,did I stand here Duke of Lancaster
9,null,null,and good Edmund of March yonder were head of realm and army . '
2094 22
 (19, 19),
1,null,null,To this the deputies consented
2,null,null,and the next day was fixed for the surrender
3,null,null,The difficulty was
4,null,null,as Henry had found at Harfleur
5,null,null,Rouen
6,null,null,and many other places
7,null,null,to enforce forbearance on his soldiery
8,null,null,who regarded plunder as their lawful prey
9,null,null,the enemy as their natural game
10,null,null,and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmerciful ness
11,null,null,The more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of English country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of men-at-arms
12,null,null,the mere greedy
13,null,null,rapacious
14,null,null,and insubordinate became their temper
15,null,null,Well knowing the greatness of the peril
16,null,null,and that the very best of his captains had scarcely the will
17,null,null,if they had the power
18,null,null,to restrain the license that soon became barbarity unimaginable
19,sadness,sadly,he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender
20,null,null,when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his escutcheon
21,null,null,but a shame to human nature
22,null,null,looking back to the exultation with which he had entered Harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness .
2095 16
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Blows hailed thick on the door
2,null,null,a flaming torch was handed over the heads of the throng
3,null,null,horrible growls and roars pervaded them
4,null,null,Malcolm and Ralf
5,anger,furious,furious at the cheat
6,null,null,stood among the foremost
7,null,null,making so much noise themselves between thundering and reviling
8,null,null,and calling out
9,null,null,' where are the Armagnacs
10,null,null,Down with the traitors
11,null,null,' that they were not aware of a sudden hush behind them
12,null,null,till a buffet from a heavy hand fell on Malcolm 's shoulder
13,null,null,and a mighty voice cried  ' shame
14,null,null,shame
15,null,null,What
16,null,null,you too
2096 6
 (1, 1),
1,fear,feared,James feared he had been mistaken
2,null,null,and looked to the influence of Esclairmonde to repair the evil
3,null,null,if perchance she should follow the Queen to France
4,null,null,And this it was almost certain she must do
5,null,null,since she was entirely dependent upon the Countess of Hainault
6,null,null,and could not obtain admission to a nunnery without recovering a portion of her estates .
2097 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Would she be there
2,fear,anxiety,That was the chief anxiety :   for it was not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on the Continent
3,null,null,and Catherine had given no intimation as to who would be in her suite so that
4,null,null,as Henry had merrily observed
5,null,null,he was the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense
6,null,null,except indeed Salisbury
7,null,null,who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come out with the Queen .
2098 8
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,James smiled and coloured with pleasure
2,null,null,the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy
3,sadness,ashamed,nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to
4,null,null,and even press to his lips
5,null,null,his lady 's first love letter
6,null,null,in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford
7,null,null,of whom he eagerly asked of the fair Joan 's health and welfare
8,null,null,and whether she were flouted by Queen Catherine .
2099 11
 (10, 7),(10, 10),
1,null,null,And on this day
2,null,null,when Esclairmonde herself had arrayed the fair child in the dainty iest of rose pink bodices edged with swan ' s-down
3,null,null,the whitest of kirtle
4,null,null,and softest of rosy veils
5,null,null,the flush of anxiety on the pale little face made it so fair to look upon
6,null,null,that as the maiden wistfully asked
7,null,null,' think you he will flout me
8,null,null,' it was impossible not to laugh at the very notion
9,null,null,' ah
10,happiness,glad,but I would be glad if he did
11,null,null,for then I might bide with you . '

1,null,null,The idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful
2,null,null,refined
3,null,null,conscientious man through the earlier times of the Reformation
4,null,null,glad of the hope of cleansing the Church
5,null,null,but hoping to cleanse
6,null,null,not to break away from her a hope that Luther himself long cherished
7,null,null,and which was not entirely frustrated till the re assembly at Trent in the next generation
8,fear,feared,Justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the one body to which the promises were made
9,null,null,Their loyalty has been treated as blindness
10,null,null,timidity
11,null,null,or superstition
12,null,null,but that there were many such persons
13,null,null,and those among the very highest minds of their time
14,null,null,no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony
15,null,null,of Erasmus
16,null,null,of Vittoria Colonna
17,null,null,or of Cardinal Giustiniani .

 (8, 8),
1,null,null,"  Ah
2,null,null,that will be well
3,null,null,"   cried Christina
4,null,null,"  Then will our wagons be no longer set upon at the Debateable Ford by Schlangenwald or Adlerstein
5,null,null,and our wares will come safely
6,null,null,and there will be wealth enough to raise our spire
7,null,null,O uncle
8,happiness,joy,what a day of joy will that be when Our Lady 's great statue will be set on the summit
2102 19
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,"  Hans shall draw off your boots
2,null,null,fair brother
3,null,null,"   began the dame
4,null,null,but poor Christina
5,fear,anxious,the more anxious to propitiate him in little things
6,null,null,because of the horror and dread with which his main purpose inspired her
7,null,null,was already on her knees
8,null,null,pulling with her small quivering hands at the long steel guarded boot a task to which she would have been utterly inadequate
9,null,null,but for some lazy assistance from her father 's other foot
10,null,null,She further brought a pair of her uncle 's furred slippers
11,null,null,while Reiter Hugh proceeded to dangle one of the boots in the air
12,null,null,expatiating on its frail condition
13,null,null,and expressing his intention of getting a new pair from Master Matthias
14,null,null,the sutor
15,null,null,ere he should leave Ulm on the morrow
16,null,null,Then
17,null,null,again
18,null,null,came the dreaded subject
19,null,null,his daughter must go with him .
2103 6
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,"  The right of parents is with those that have done the duty of parents
2,null,null,"   returned Johanna
3,null,null,"  What said the kid in the fable to the goat that claimed her from the sheep that bred her up
4,disgust,ashamed,I am ashamed of you
5,null,null,house father
6,null,null,for not better loving your own niece  .  "
2104 30
 (15, 16),
1,null,null,In a few minutes he appeared
2,null,null,an aged man
3,null,null,with a sensible face
4,null,null,of the fresh pure bloom preserved by a temperate life
5,null,null,He was a secular parish priest
6,null,null,and
7,null,null,as well as his friend Master Gottfried
8,null,null,held greatly by the views left by the famous Strasburg preacher
9,null,null,Master John Tauler
10,null,null,After the good housemother had
11,null,null,in strong terms
12,null,null,laid the case before him
13,null,null,she expected a trenchant decision on her own side
14,null,null,but
15,surprise,to her surprise and disappointment,to her surprise and disappointment
16,null,null,he declared that Master Gottfried was right
17,null,null,and that
18,null,null,unless Hugh Sorel demanded anything absolutely sinful of his daughter
19,null,null,it was needful that she should submit
20,null,null,He repeated
21,null,null,in stronger terms
22,null,null,the assurance that she would be protected in the endeavour to do right
23,null,null,and the Divine promises which he quoted from the Latin Scriptures gave some comfort to the niece
24,null,null,who understood them
25,null,null,while they impressed the aunt
26,null,null,who did not
27,null,null,There was always the hope that
28,null,null,whether the young lady died or recovered
29,null,null,the conclusion of her illness would be the term of Christina 's stay at Adlerstein
30,null,null,and with this trust Johanna must content herself .
2105 14
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,The words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation
2,null,null,the stranger to Christina 's ears
3,null,null,because intercourse with foreign merchants
4,null,null,and a growing affectation of Latin ism
5,null,null,had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed
6,surprise,surprised,and she was surprised to perceive by her father 's gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the castle
7,null,null,She looked up
8,null,null,and saw on the pathway above her a tall
9,null,null,large framed young man
10,null,null,his skin dyed red with sun and wind
11,null,null,in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair
12,null,null,moustache
13,null,null,and beard
14,null,null,as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the other .
2106 8
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,happy,Esclairmonde would have been happy if no one had noticed her benevolence to the young Scot save Alice Montagu
2,null,null,but she had to endure countless railleries from every lady
3,null,null,from Countess Jaqueline downwards
4,null,null,on the unmistakable evidence that her heart had spoken
5,null,null,and her grave dignity had less effect in silencing them than usual
6,null,null,so diverting was the alleged triumph over her propriety
7,null,null,well as they knew that she would have done the same for the youngest horse boy
8,null,null,or the oldest man-at-arms .
2107 8
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,For one brief week
2,happiness,happy,Esclairmonde and Alice were very happy in this secret hope
3,null,null,but at the end of that time the Bishop of Therouenne appeared
4,null,null,Esclairmonde had ventured to hope that the King 's influence
5,null,null,and likewise the fact that her intention was not to enrich one of the regular monastic orders
6,null,null,might lead him to lend a favourable ear to her scheme
7,null,null,but she was by no means prepared to find him already informed of the affair of the Dance of Death
8,null,null,and putting his own construction on it .
2108 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,If the illness had only been confessed
2,null,null,those who watched the King anxiously would have had more hope
3,anger,angered,but he was hotly angered at any hint of his needing care
4,null,null,and though he sometimes relieved oppression by causing himself to be bled by a servant
5,null,null,he never allowed that anything ailed him
6,null,null,it was always the hot weather
7,null,null,the anxious tidings
8,null,null,the long pageant that wearied him things that were wont to be like gnats on a lion 's mane .
2109 18
 (17, 17),
1,null,null,Those solemn banquets and festivals lasting from forenoon till eventide
2,null,null,with their endless relays of allegorical subtleties
3,null,null,their long-winded harangues
4,null,null,noisy music
5,null,null,interludes of giants
6,null,null,sylvan men
7,null,null,distressed damsels
8,null,null,knights errant on horseback
9,null,null,ships and forests coming in upon wheels
10,null,null,and fulsome compliments that must be answered had been always his aversion
11,null,null,and were now so heavy an oppression that Bedford would have persuaded the Queen to curtail them
12,null,null,But to the fair Catherine this appeared an unkind endeavour of her disagreeable brother-in-law
13,null,null,to prevent her from shining in her native city
14,null,null,and eclipsing the Burgundian pomp
15,null,null,and she opened her soft brown eyes in dignified displeasure
16,null,null,answering that she saw nothing amiss with the King
17,disgust,complained,and she likewise complained to her husband of his brother 's jealousy of her welcome from her own people
18,null,null,bringing on him one of Henry 's most bitter sentences .
2110 24
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,Here were the malicious defraud ers of the hungry warriors
2,null,null,Down upon them flew the angry foragers
3,null,null,Soon the pretty tranquil scene was ringing with the oaths of the plundering and the cries of the plundered
4,null,null,the cattle were being driven off
5,null,null,the houses and farm yards rifled
6,null,null,blood was flowing
7,null,null,and what could not be carried off was burning
8,null,null,The search for the Armagnac prisoner had
9,null,null,however
10,null,null,relaxed after the first inquiry
11,null,null,and Malcolm
12,surprise,surprised,surprised that this had been forgotten
13,null,null,suddenly bethought him of the distinction he should secure by sending a valuable prize to Esclairmonde 's feet
14,null,null,He seized on an old man who had not been able to fly
15,null,null,and stood trembling and panting in a corner
16,null,null,and demanded where the sick man was
17,null,null,The old man pointed to a farmhouse
18,null,null,round which clouds of smoke were rolling
19,null,null,and Malcolm hurried into it
20,null,null,shouting
21,null,null,' dog of an Armagnac
22,null,null,come out
23,null,null,Yield
24,null,null,ere thou be burnt
2111 16
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy
2,null,null,summoned Sir Nigel to his side
3,null,null,closed his own visor
4,null,null,and called for water
5,null,null,then hung over the prisoner
6,fear,anxious,anxious to prevent the first word from being broad Scotch
7,null,null,In the free air
8,null,null,some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life
9,null,null,and James at once said
10,null,null,' rendez vous
11,null,null,My Lord
12,null,null,' but he neither answered
13,null,null,nor was there meaning in his eyes
14,null,null,And James perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs
15,null,null,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,null,null,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms .
2112 35
 (31, 29),(31, 30),
1,null,null,Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick man left by the enemy
2,null,null,summoned Sir Nigel to his side
3,null,null,closed his own visor
4,null,null,and called for water
5,null,null,then hung over the prisoner
6,null,null,anxious to prevent the first word from being broad Scotch
7,null,null,In the free air
8,null,null,some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life
9,null,null,and James at once said
10,null,null,' rendez vous
11,null,null,My Lord
12,null,null,' but he neither answered
13,null,null,nor was there meaning in his eyes
14,null,null,And James perceived that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs
15,null,null,and that his right shoulder was dislocated
16,null,null,and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when Malcolm had grasped him by the arms
17,null,null,He swooned again at the first attempt to lift him
18,null,null,and a hay cart having been left in the flight of the marauders
19,null,null,he was laid in it
20,null,null,and covered with the King 's cloak
21,null,null,to be conveyed to Corbeil
22,null,null,where James trusted to secure his life by personal intercession with Henry
23,null,null,He groaned heavily several times
24,null,null,but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way
25,null,null,and James and Sir Nigel kept on either side of the cart
26,null,null,ready to address him in French the first moment
27,null,null,having told the English that he was a prisoner of quality
28,null,null,who must be carefully conveyed to King James 's tent at Corbeil
29,null,null,Malcolm was not allowed to approach
30,null,null,lest he should be recognized
31,sadness,in an agony of shame and suspense,and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense
32,null,null,with very different feelings towards Patrick than those with which he had of late thought of him
33,null,null,or of his own promises
34,null,null,If Patrick died through this plundering raid
35,null,null,how should he ever face Lily
2113 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Nothing had passed about Patrick Drummond
2,null,null,nor the high words of last night
3,null,null,Henry seemed to have forgotten them
4,fear,anxiety,between his bodily suffering and the anxiety of being forced to relinquish the command just before a battle
5,null,null,and James would have felt it ungenerous to harass him at such a moment
6,null,null,when absolutely committed to his charge
7,null,null,For the present
8,null,null,there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority
9,null,null,since the King had promised to take cognizance of the case
10,null,null,and the chief danger was from his chance discovery by some lawless man-at-arms
11,null,null,who would think himself doing good service by killing a concealed Scot under any circumstances .
2114 26
 (12, 12),
1,null,null,Patrick 's life was granted
2,null,null,although it had been promised too late to send the intelligence back to the tent at Corbeil
3,null,null,So far
4,null,null,the purpose of his vow to St
5,null,null,Andrew had been accomplished
6,null,null,but with the probability that he should soon again be associated with Patrick
7,null,null,came the sense of the failure in purpose and in promise
8,null,null,Patrick would not reproach him
9,null,null,he well knew nay
10,null,null,would rejoice in the change
11,null,null,but even this certainty galled him
12,sadness,shame,and made him dread his cousin 's presence as likely to bring him a sense of shame
13,null,null,What would Patrick think of his letting a lady be absolutely compelled to marry him
14,null,null,Might he not say it was the part of Walter Stewart over again
15,null,null,Indeed
16,null,null,Malcolm remembered how carefully King James was prevented from hearing the means by which the Countess intended to make the lady his own
17,null,null,and a sensation came over him
18,null,null,that it was profanation to call on St
19,null,null,Andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means
20,null,null,Why was it that
21,null,null,as his eyes fell on the face of King Henry
22,null,null,the whole world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring
23,null,null,and a sentence he had once heard Esclairmonde quote would come to him constantly :   ' my son
24,null,null,think not to buy off God
25,null,null,It is thyself that He requires
26,null,null,not thy gifts . '
2115 14
 (13, 13),
1,null,null,"  O let me see
2,null,null,"   cried the young lady eagerly
3,null,null,and Sir Eberhard
4,null,null,walking off
5,null,null,presently returned with an armful of the beautiful brindled furs of the mountain cat
6,null,null,reminding Christina of her aunt 's gentle domestic favourite
7,null,null,Ermentrude sat up
8,null,null,and regarded the placing out of them with great interest
9,null,null,and thus her brother left her employed
10,null,null,and so much delighted that she had not flagged
11,null,null,when a great bell proclaimed that it was the time for the noon tide meal
12,null,null,for which Christina
13,fear,fears,in spite of all her fears of the company below stairs
14,null,null,had been constrained by mountain air to look forward with satisfaction .
2116 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Ermentrude
2,null,null,she found
3,null,null,meant to go down
4,null,null,but with no notion of the personal arrangements that Christina had been wont to think a needful preliminary
5,null,null,With all her hair streaming
6,null,null,down she went
7,null,null,and was so gladly welcomed by her father that it was plain that her presence was regarded as an unusual advance towards recovery
8,fear,feared,and Christina feared lest he might already be looking out for the stout husband
9,null,null,She had much to tell him about the catskin cloak
10,null,null,and then she was seized with eager curiosity at the sight of Christina 's bundles
11,null,null,and especially at her lute
12,null,null,which she must hear at once .
2117 7
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,And this was Christina 's charge
2,null,null,whom she must look upon as the least alien spirit in this dreadful castle of banishment
3,null,null,The young and old lords seemed to her savage bandits
4,null,null,who frightened her only less than did the proud sinister expression of the old lady
5,null,null,for she had not even the merit of showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl
6,sadness,ashamed,of whom she was ashamed
7,null,null,and evidently regarded the town bred attendant as a contemptible interloper .
2118 14
 (11, 11),(11, 12),
1,null,null,Long
2,null,null,long did the maiden weep and pray that night after Ermentrude had sunk to sleep
3,null,null,She strained her eyes with home sick longings to detect lights where she thought Ulm might be
4,null,null,and
5,null,null,as she thought of her uncle and aunt
6,null,null,the poodle and the cat round the stove
7,null,null,the maids spinning and the apprentices knitting as her uncle read aloud some grave good book
8,null,null,most probably the legend of the saint of the day
9,null,null,and contrasted it with the rude gruff sounds of revelry that found their way up the turret stairs
10,null,null,she could hardly restrain her sobs from awakening the young lady whose bed she was to share
11,happiness,envy,She thought almost with envy of her own patroness
12,null,null,who was cast into the lake of Bolsena with a millstone about her neck a better fate
13,null,null,thought she
14,null,null,than to live on in such an abode of loathsome ness and peril .
2119 30
 (14, 13),(14, 14),
1,null,null,Therewith she made a great difference in the aspect of the chamber
2,null,null,under the full sanction of the lords of the castle
3,null,null,Wolf
4,null,null,deer
5,null,null,and sheep skins abounded
6,null,null,and with these
7,null,null,assisted by her father and old Hatto
8,null,null,she tapestry ied the lower part of the bare grim walls
9,null,null,a great bear 's hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth
10,null,null,and cushions were made of these skins
11,null,null,and stuffed from Ursel 's stores of feathers
12,null,null,All these embellishments were watched with great delight by Ermentrude
13,null,null,who had never been made of so much importance
14,surprise,surprised,and was as much surprised as relieved by such attentions
15,null,null,She was too young and too delicate to reject civilization
16,null,null,and she let Christina braid her hair
17,null,null,bathe her
18,null,null,and arrange her dress
19,null,null,with sensations of comfort that were almost like health
20,null,null,To train her into occupying herself was however
21,null,null,as Christina soon found
22,null,null,in her present state
23,null,null,impossible
24,null,null,She could spin and sew a little
25,null,null,but hated both
26,null,null,and her clumsy
27,null,null,listless fingers only soiled and wasted Christina 's needles
28,null,null,silk
29,null,null,and lute strings
30,null,null,and such damage was not so easily remedied as in the streets of Ulm .
2120 22
 (22, 22),
1,null,null,Much of his time was spent on the child
2,null,null,whose chief nurse and playmate he had been throughout her malady
3,null,null,and when she showed him the stranger 's arrangements
4,null,null,or repeated to him
5,null,null,in a wondering
6,null,null,blundering way
7,null,null,with constant appeals to her attendant
8,null,null,the new tales she had heard
9,null,null,he used to listen with a pleased awkward amazement at his little Ermentrude 's astonishing cleverness
10,null,null,joined sometimes with real interest
11,null,null,which was evinced by his inquiries of Christina
12,null,null,He certainly did not admire the little
13,null,null,slight
14,null,null,pale bower maiden
15,null,null,but he seemed to look upon her like some strange
16,null,null,almost uncanny
17,null,null,wise spirit out of some other sphere
18,null,null,and his manner towards her had none of the offensive freedom apparent in even the old man 's patronage
19,null,null,It was
20,null,null,as Ermentrude once said
21,null,null,laughing
22,fear,feared,almost as if he feared that she might do something to him .
2121 12
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Probably the low toned softness of the voice
2,null,null,so utterly different from the shrill wrangling notes of all the other women he had known
3,surprise,surprise,took him by surprise
4,null,null,He was still sober enough to be subdued
5,null,null,almost cowed
6,null,null,by resistance of a description unlike all he had ever seen
7,null,null,his alarm at Christina 's superior power returned in full force
8,null,null,he staggered to the stairs
9,null,null,Christina rushed after him
10,null,null,closed the heavy door with all her force
11,null,null,fastened it inside
12,null,null,and would have sunk down to weep but for Ermentrude 's peevish wail of distress .
2122 26
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,So the door remained shut
2,null,null,and Christina 's resolve was taken that she would so keep it while the wine lasted
3,null,null,And
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,Ermentrude had so much fever all that night and the next day that no going down could be thought of
6,null,null,Nobody came near the maidens but Ursel
7,disgust,fear and disgust,and she described one continued orgies that made Christina shudder again with fear and disgust
8,null,null,Those below revelled without interval
9,null,null,except for sleep
10,null,null,and they took their sleep just where they happened to sink down
11,null,null,then returned again to the liquor
12,null,null,The old baroness repaired to the kitchen when the revelry went beyond even her bearing
13,null,null,but all the time the wine held out
14,null,null,the swine in the court were
15,null,null,as Ursel averred
16,null,null,better company than the men in the hall
17,null,null,Yet there might have been worse even than this
18,null,null,for old Ursel whispered that at the bottom of the stairs there was a trap door
19,null,null,Did the maiden know what it covered
20,null,null,It was an oubliette
21,null,null,There was once a Strasburg armourer who had refused ransom
22,null,null,and talked of appealing to the Kaiser
23,null,null,He trod on that door and Ursel pointed downwards
24,null,null,"  But since that time
25,null,null,"   she said
26,null,null,"  my young lord has never brought home a prisoner .  "
2123 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,Christina dreaded indeed that the roads should be open
2,null,null,but she could not love the snow
3,null,null,it spoke to her of dreariness
4,null,null,savagery
5,null,null,and captivity
6,null,null,and she watched the dwindling stripes with satisfaction
7,happiness,rejoiced,and hailed the fall of the petty avalanches from one Eagle 's Step to another as her forefathers might have rejoiced in the defeat of the Frost giants .
2124 8
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Do you include violin playing in your category of rows
2,null,null,he asked
3,fear,anxiously,anxiously
4,null,null,He was not studying medicine
5,null,null,He had himself
6,null,null,in reply to a question
7,null,null,confirmed Stamford  s opinion upon that point
8,null,null,Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance in to the learned world .
2125 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable
2,surprise,astounded,and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me
3,null,null,Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view
4,null,null,Desultory readers are seldom  remarkable for the exactness of their learning .
2126 4
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,contempt,Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt
2,null,null,They evidently failed to appreciate the fact
3,null,null,which I had begun to realize
4,null,null,that Sherlock Holmes  s smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end .
2127 9
 (7, 5),
1,null,null,It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I were to presume to help you
2,null,null,remarked my friend
3,null,null,You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere
4,null,null,There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke
5,null,null,If you will let me know how your investigations go
6,null,null,he continued
7,happiness,happy,I shall be happy to give you any help I can
8,null,null,In the mean time I should like to speak to the constable who found the body
9,null,null,Can you give me his name and address
2128 11
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,I was a strolling   down
2,null,null,thinkin   between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be
3,null,null,when suddenly the glint of alight caught my eye in the window of that same house

9,null,null,his wife and  daughter
10,null,null,the first sounds that dropped from Manfred 's lips were

8,null,null,he disengaged himself  from Manfred 's grip
9,null,null,and then with an obeisance
10,null,null,which discovered more  jealousy of innocence than dismay

13,null,null,of what he  was guilty
14,null,null,Manfred
15,null,null,more enraged at the vigour
16,null,null,however decently  exerted
17,null,null,with which the young man had shaken off his hold
18,null,null,than  appeased by his submission
19,null,null,ordered his attendants to seize him
20,null,null,and
21,null,null,if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the  nuptials

1,null,null,"  Perhaps my mind would be less affected
2,null,null,"   said Matilda

4,null,null,that inspires me with this - I know not what to call it
5,null,null,As she never  acts from caprice
6,null,null,I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom -  nay

6,sadness,ashamed,and am not ashamed of owing my support to myself  - yet think me not proud
7,null,null,or that I disdain your generous offers
8,null,null,I  will remember you in my orisons
9,null,null,and will pray for blessings on your  gracious self and your noble mistress - if I sigh
10,null,null,Lady
11,null,null,it is for  others
12,null,null,not for myself .  "

6,null,null,that his impatience for a son would direct him to  some other object
7,null,null,who might not be equally proof against the  temptation of Manfred 's rank
8,null,null,For some time the holy man remained  absorbed in thought
9,null,null,At length
10,null,null,conceiving some hopes from delay
11,null,null,he  thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from  despairing of recovering Isabella
2137 9

4,null,null,"  How glad I am we have met with Mrs
5,null,null,Thorpe
6,null,null,"   and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families
7,null,null,as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be
8,happiness,satisfied,never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs Thorpe
9,null,null,in what they called conversation
10,null,null,but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion
11,null,null,and not often any resemblance of subject
12,null,null,for Mrs

14,null,null,if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you

8,null,null,but was likewise aware that
9,null,null,as the real dignity of her situation could not be known
10,null,null,she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner .

 (2, 1),
1,null,null,From this state of humiliation
2,anger,roused,she was roused
3,null,null,at the end of ten minutes
4,null,null,to a more pleasant feeling
5,null,null,by seeing
6,null,null,not Mr Thorpe
7,null,null,but Mr Tilney
8,null,null,within three yards of the place where they sat
9,null,null,he seemed to be moving that way
10,null,null,but he did not see her
11,null,null,and therefore the smile and the blush
12,null,null,which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine
13,null,null,passed away without sullying her heroic importance .

 (15, 14),
1,null,null,Mr Tilney and his companion
2,null,null,who continued
3,null,null,though slowly
4,null,null,to approach
5,null,null,were immediately preceded by a lady
6,null,null,an acquaintance of Mrs
7,null,null,Thorpe
8,null,null,and this lady stopping to speak to her
9,null,null,they
10,null,null,as belonging to her
11,null,null,stopped likewise
12,null,null,and Catherine
13,null,null,catching Mr Tilney 's eye
14,null,null,instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition
15,happiness,pleasure,She returned it with pleasure
16,null,null,and then advancing still nearer
17,null,null,he spoke both to her and Mrs
18,null,null,Allen
19,null,null,by whom he was very civilly acknowledged .
2436 26
 (25, 13),
1,null,null,"  I tell you
2,null,null,Mr Morland
3,null,null,"   she cried
4,null,null,"  I would not do such a thing for all the world
5,null,null,How can you be so teasing

7,null,null,my dear Catherine
8,null,null,what your brother wants me to do
9,null,null,He wants me to dance with him again
10,null,null,though I tell him that it is a most improper thing
11,null,null,and entirely against the rules
12,null,null,It would make us the talk of the place
13,null,null,if we were not to change partners

16,null,null,"  in these public assemblies
17,null,null,it is as often done as not

19,null,null,how can you say so
20,null,null,But when you men have a point to carry
21,null,null,you never stick at anything
22,null,null,My sweet Catherine
23,null,null,do support me
24,null,null,persuade your brother how impossible it is
25,surprise,shock,Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing
26,null,null,now would not it

2,null,null,He has got a partner

17,null,null,that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world

19,null,null,but it did not puzzle Mrs
20,null,null,Allen
21,null,null,for after only a moment 's consideration

4,null,null,as he handed her in
5,null,null,"  if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off
6,null,null,He will
7,null,null,most likely
8,null,null,give a plunge or two
9,null,null,and perhaps take the rest for a minute
10,null,null,but he will soon know his master

36,surprise,astonishment,Catherine listened with astonishment
37,null,null,she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing
38,null,null,for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle

 (3, 4),
1,null,null,When they arrived at Mrs
2,null,null,Allen 's door
3,surprise,astonishment,the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed
4,null,null,on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house :   "  Past three o'clock
5,null,null,"   It was inconceivable
6,null,null,incredible
7,null,null,impossible
2444 16
 (15, 15),
1,null,null,And she would neither believe her own watch
2,null,null,nor her brother 's
3,null,null,nor the servant 's
4,null,null,she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality
5,null,null,till Morland produced his watch
6,null,null,and ascertained the fact
7,null,null,to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable
8,null,null,incredible
9,null,null,and impossible
10,null,null,and she could only protest
11,null,null,over and over again
12,null,null,that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before
13,null,null,as Catherine was called on to confirm
14,null,null,Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella
15,sadness,misery,but the latter was spared the misery of her friend 's dissenting voice
16,null,null,by not waiting for her answer .

1,null,null,Her own feelings entirely engrossed her
2,sadness,wretchedness,her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home

5,null,null,though she had such thousands of things to say to her

1,null,null,Catherine 's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning

3,fear,alarm,she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention .
2450 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend
2,null,null,by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney

4,null,null,and whom she instantly joined
5,null,null,with a firmer determination to be acquainted
6,null,null,than she might have had courage to command
7,null,null,had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before .
2451 9
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before
2,happiness,exulting,She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe
3,null,null,and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight
4,null,null,lest he should engage her again

1,null,null,So Fledge came lower and lower
2,null,null,As they came down nearer to the earth and among the hills
3,null,null,the air grew warmer and after travelling so many hours with nothing to listen to but the beat of Fledge 's wings
4,null,null,it was nice to hear the homely and earthy noises again - the chatter of the river on its stony bed and the creaking of trees in the light wind
5,null,null,A warm
6,null,null,good smell of sun baked earth and grass and flowers came up to them
7,null,null,At last Fledge alighted
8,null,null,Digory rolled off and helped Polly to dismount

2455 20
 (20, 12),
1,null,null,"  Well
2,null,null,tuck in
3,null,null,"   said Fledge
4,null,null,taking a big mouthful of grass
5,null,null,Then he raised his head
6,null,null,still chewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers
7,null,null,and said
8,null,null,"  Come on
9,null,null,you two
10,null,null,dont be shy
11,null,null,There 's plenty for us all
12,null,null,"  But we cant eat grass
13,null,null,"   said Digory
14,null,null,"  Hmm
15,null,null,hmm
16,null,null,"   said Fledge
17,null,null,speaking with his mouth full
18,null,null,"  Well - hmm - dont know quite what youll do then
19,null,null,Very good grass too
20,sadness,stared at one another in dismay,Polly and Digory stared at one another in dismay .
2456 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,When Fledge had quite finished his own excellent supper he lay down
2,null,null,The children came and sat one on each side of him leaning against his warm body
3,happiness,snug,and when he had spread a wing over each they were really quite snug
4,null,null,As the bright young stars of that new world came out they talked over everything :  how Digory had hoped to get something for his Mother and how
5,null,null,instead of that
6,null,null,he had been sent on this message .
2457 13
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Fledge came lower and lower in wide circles
2,null,null,The icy peaks rose up higher and higher above
3,null,null,The air came up warmer and sweeter every moment
4,happiness,brought the tears to your eyes,so sweet that it almost brought the tears to your eyes
5,null,null,Fledge was now gliding with his wings spread out motionless on each side
6,null,null,and his hoofs pawing for the ground
7,null,null,The steep green hill was rushing towards them
8,null,null,A moment later he alighted on its slope
9,null,null,a little awkwardly
10,null,null,The children rolled off
11,null,null,fell without hurting themselves on the warm
12,null,null,fine grass
13,null,null,and stood up panting a little .
2458 16
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Digory was just turning to go back to the gates when he stopped to have one last look around
2,fear,got a terrible shock,He got a terrible shock
3,null,null,He was not alone
4,null,null,There
5,null,null,only a few yards away from him
6,null,null,stood the Witch
7,null,null,She was just throwing away the core of an apple which she had eaten
8,null,null,The juice was darker than you would expect and had made a horrid stain round her mouth
9,null,null,Digory guessed at once that she must have climbed in over the wall
10,null,null,And he began to see that there might be some sense in that last line about getting your heart 's desire and getting despair along with it
11,null,null,For the Witch looked stronger and prouder than ever
12,null,null,and even
13,null,null,in a way
14,null,null,triumphant
15,null,null,but her face was deadly white
16,null,null,white as salt .
2459 6
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,WELL done
2,null,null,"   said Aslan in a voice that made the earth shake
3,null,null,Then Digory knew that all the Narnians had heard those words and that the story of them would be handed down from father to son in that new world for hundreds of years and perhaps forever
4,null,null,But he was in no danger of feeling conceited for he didnt think about it at all now that he was face to face with Aslan
5,null,null,This time he found he could look straight into the Lion 's eyes
6,happiness,felt absolutely content,He had forgotten his troubles and felt absolutely content .
2460 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,And he was sure now that her face looked a little different
2,null,null,He bent down and kissed her very softly and stole out of the room with a beating heart
3,null,null,taking the core of the apple with him
4,null,null,For the rest of that day
5,null,null,whenever he looked at the things about him
6,null,null,and saw how ordinary and un magical they were
7,null,null,he hardly dared to hope
8,happiness,did hope,but when he remembered the face of Aslan he did hope .
2461 3
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,in great peace and joy,In Narnia the Beasts lived in great peace and joy and neither the Witch nor any other enemy came to trouble that pleasant land for many hundred years
2,null,null,King Frank and Queen Helen and their children lived happily in Narnia and their second son became King of Archenland
3,null,null,The boys married nymphs and the girls married wood gods and river gods .

1,null,null,It was of course the Lion 's voice
2,surprise,lovely and terrible shock,The children had long felt sure that he could speak :  yet it was a lovely and terrible shock when he did .

1,null,null,"  Good old Strawberry
2,null,null,"   said Polly
3,happiness,glad,"  I am glad he was one of the ones picked out to be a Talking Beast
4,null,null,And the Cabby

6,null,null,said
7,null,null,"  Strike me pink
8,null,null,I always did say that ' oss ' ad a lot of sense

 (12, 13),
1,null,null,A Panther
2,null,null,which had been washing its face
3,null,null,stopped for a moment to say
4,null,null,"  Well
5,null,null,if they are
6,null,null,theyre nothing like so good as the first one
7,null,null,At least
8,null,null,1 dont see anything very funny about them
9,null,null,It yawned and went on with its wash
10,null,null,please
11,null,null,"   said Digory
12,fear,in such a hurry,"  im in such a hurry
13,null,null,I want to see the Lion .  "

7,null,null,I have never seen my Papa cry and dont know what to do .
2466 6
 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,sadness,ashamed,I was immediately ashamed of myself for my vanity
2,null,null,for having assumed that he wanted me to stay with him forever so that he could indulge my whims till the end of time
3,null,null,"  im sorry

1,null,null,We walked over to his neighbor 's compound together
2,null,null,It was a considerable distance and we had to walk on the busy main road for a while
3,null,null,i 'd been in Bali almost four months
4,null,null,and had never seen Ketut leave his compound before
5,sadness,disconcerting,It was disconcerting watching him walk down the highway amid all the speeding cars and madcap motorcycles
6,null,null,He looked so tiny and vulnerable
7,null,null,He looked so wrong set against this modern backdrop of traffic and honking horns
8,null,null,It made me want to cry
9,null,null,for some reason
10,null,null,but I was feeling a little extra emotive today anyway .

2,null,null,It was a considerable distance and we had to walk on the busy main road for a while
3,null,null,i 'd been in Bali almost four months
4,null,null,and had never seen Ketut leave his compound before
5,null,null,It was disconcerting watching him walk down the highway amid all the speeding cars and madcap motorcycles

1,null,null,It was all strangely casual amid all the ancient ritualistic formality
2,null,null,sort of backyard picnic meets high church
3,null,null,The mantras Ketut chanted to the baby were so sweet
4,null,null,sounding like a combination of the sacred and the affectionate

4,null,null,there goes
5,null,null,they lightly dipped the baby 's feet in this pottery bowl full of holy water
6,null,null,right above the magic drawing which encompassed the whole universe
7,null,null,and then they touched her soles to the earth for the first time
8,null,null,When they lifted her back up into the air
9,null,null,tiny damp footprints remained on the ground below her
10,null,null,orienting this child at last onto the great Balinese grid

10,null,null,and once Jo marched home
11,null,null,declaring she could n't bear it longer
12,null,null,but Aunt March always cleared up quickly
13,null,null,and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse

1,null,null,Jo 's ambition was to do something very splendid
2,null,null,What it was
3,null,null,she had no idea as yet

5,null,null,and meanwhile
6,null,null,found her greatest affliction in the fact that she could n't read

8,null,null,and ride as much as she liked
9,null,null,A quick temper
10,null,null,sharp tongue
11,null,null,and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes
12,null,null,and her life was a series of ups and downs
13,null,null,which were both comic and pathetic

5,null,null,Having no top to its head
6,null,null,she tied on a neat little cap
7,null,null,and as both arms and legs were gone
8,null,null,she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid

5,null,null,She loved music so dearly
6,null,null,tried so hard to learn
7,null,null,and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument
8,null,null,that it did seem as if someone ( not to hint Aunt March ) ought to help her .

3,null,null,only level grass and daisies
4,null,null,and ivy
5,null,null,and grey walls
6,null,null,It was a bright
7,null,null,secret
8,null,null,quiet place
9,null,null,and rather sad
10,null,null,and all four stepped out into the middle of it
11,happiness,glad,glad to be able to straighten their backs and move their limbs freely .

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,shed many tears,Caspian missed his nurse very much and shed many tears
2,null,null,and because he was so miserable
3,null,null,he thought about the old stories of Narnia far more than before
4,null,null,He dreamed of Dwarfs and Dryads every night and tried very hard to make the dogs and cats in the castle talk to him
5,null,null,But the dogs only wagged their tails and the cats only purred .
2509 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Of all his lessons with Doctor Cornelius the one that Caspian liked best was History
2,null,null,Up till now
3,null,null,except for Nurse 's stories
4,null,null,he had known nothing about the History of Narnia
5,surprise,surprised,and he was very surprised to learn that the royal family were newcomers in the country .
2510 4
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,After that it was all nouns and verbs till lunchtime
2,null,null,but I dont think Caspian learned much
3,happiness,excited,He was too excited
4,null,null,He felt sure that Doctor Cornelius would not have said so much unless he meant to tell him more sooner or later .
2511 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,This didnt seem to have anything to do with Old Narnia
2,null,null,which was what Caspian really wanted to hear about
3,happiness,pleased,but getting up in the middle of the night is always interesting and he was moderately pleased
4,null,null,When he went to bed that night
5,null,null,he thought at first that he would not be able to sleep
6,null,null,but he soon dropped off and it seemed only a few minutes before he felt someone gently shaking him .
2512 15
 (14, 13),(14, 15),
1,null,null,Caspian followed the Doctor through many passages and up several staircases
2,null,null,and at last
3,null,null,through a little door in a turret
4,null,null,they came out upon the leads
5,null,null,On one side were the battlements
6,null,null,on the other a steep roof
7,null,null,below them
8,null,null,all shadowy and shimmery
9,null,null,the castle gardens
10,null,null,above them
11,null,null,stars and moon
12,null,null,Presently they came to another door
13,null,null,which led into the great central tower of the whole castle :  Doctor Cornelius unlocked it and they began to climb the dark winding stair of the tower
14,happiness,excited,Caspian was becoming excited
15,null,null,he had never been allowed up this stair before .
2513 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,I do wish we had not
3,null,null,"   said Caspian
4,happiness,glad,"  And I am glad it was all true
5,null,null,even if it is all over .  "
2514 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,"  Your Highness speaks as you have been taught
2,null,null,"   said the Doctor
3,null,null,"  But it is all lies
4,null,null,There are no ghosts there
5,null,null,That is a story invented by the Telmarines
6,fear,fear,Your Kings are in deadly fear of the sea because they can never quite forget that in all stories Aslan comes from over the sea
7,null,null,They dont want to go near it and they dont want anyone else to go near it
8,null,null,So they have let great woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast .
2515 10
 (6, 4),(6, 5),
1,null,null,"  Hush
2,null,null,"   said the Doctor
3,null,null,"  Trust me and do exactly as I tell you
4,null,null,Put on all your clothes
5,null,null,you have a long journey before you
6,surprise,surprised,Caspian was very surprised
7,null,null,but he had learned to have confidence in his Tutor and he began doing what he was told at once
8,null,null,When he was dressed the Doctor said
9,null,null,"  I have a wallet for you
10,null,null,We must go into the next room and fill it with victuals from your Highness 's supper table .  "
2516 14
 (14, 14),
1,null,null,Destrier was as excited as his master at this unusual journey
2,null,null,and Caspian
3,null,null,though tears had come into his eyes at saying good bye to Doctor Cornelius
4,null,null,felt brave and
5,null,null,in a way
6,null,null,happy
7,null,null,to think that he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures
8,null,null,with his sword on his left hip and Queen Susan 's magic horn on his right
9,null,null,But when day came
10,null,null,with a sprinkle of rain
11,null,null,and he looked about him and saw on every side unknown woods
12,null,null,wild heaths
13,null,null,and blue mountains
14,fear,frightened,he thought how large and strange the world was and felt frightened and small .
2517 10
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,When the great night came
2,happiness,swelled,and his various strange subjects came stealing into the lawn by ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens - the moon then shining almost at her full - his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings
3,null,null,All whom he had met were there :  Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs
4,null,null,Moles and Badgers
5,null,null,Hares and Hedgehogs
6,null,null,and others whom he had not yet seen - five Satyrs as red as foxes
7,null,null,the whole contingent of Talking Mice
8,null,null,armed to the teeth and following a shrill trumpet
9,null,null,some Owls
10,null,null,the Old Raven of Ravenscaur .
2518 19
 (17, 16),
1,null,null,Everyone waited in silence while the three Dwarfs and two Badgers trotted stealthily across to the trees on the northwest side of the Lawn
2,null,null,Then came a sharp dwarfish cry
3,null,null,"  Stop
4,null,null,Who goes there
5,null,null,"   and a sudden spring
6,null,null,A moment later a voice
7,null,null,which Caspian knew well
8,null,null,could he heard saying
9,null,null,"  All right
10,null,null,all right
11,null,null,im unarmed
12,null,null,Take my wrists if you like
13,null,null,worthy Badgers
14,null,null,but dont bite right through them
15,null,null,I want to speak to the King
16,null,null,Doctor Cornelius
17,happiness,cried Caspian with joy,"   cried Caspian with joy
18,null,null,and rushed forward to greet his old tutor
19,null,null,Everyone else crowded round .
2519 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It was heart-breaking work - all uphill again
2,null,null,back over the ground they had already travelled
3,null,null,When they felt that they really could n't run any more
4,null,null,even to save their lives
5,null,null,they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big boulder
6,null,null,panting
7,surprise,surprised,They were surprised to see how high they had already got .
2520 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  Oh dear
2,null,null,oh dear
3,null,null,"   said Lucy
4,happiness,pleased,"  And I was so pleased at finding you again
5,null,null,And I thought you 'd let me stay
6,null,null,And I thought you 'd come roaring in and frighten all the enemies away - like last time
7,null,null,And now everything is going to be horrid .  "
2521 7
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,come on
3,null,null,"   growled Edmund
4,null,null,"  we 've got to go
5,null,null,there 'll be no peace till we do
6,null,null,He fully intended to back Lucy up
7,disgust,annoyed,but he was annoyed at losing his night 's sleep and was making up for it by doing everything as sulkily as possible .
2522 7
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,null,null,Aslan
3,null,null,"   said King Peter
4,null,null,dropping on one knee and raising the Lion 's heavy paw to his face
5,null,null,"  im so glad
6,sadness,sorry,And im so sorry
7,null,null,i 've been leading them wrong ever since we started and especially yesterday morning .  "

2,null,null,"   came a thin
3,null,null,whining voice
4,null,null,"  So please you

2524 7
 (1, 1),(1, 3),
1,sadness,sorry,"  I am sorry for Nikabrik
2,null,null,"   said Caspian
3,null,null,"  though he hated me from the first moment he saw me
4,null,null,He had gone sour inside from long suffering and hating
5,null,null,If we had won quickly he might have become a good Dwarf in the days of peace
6,null,null,I dont know which of us killed him
7,null,null,im glad of that .  "
2525 8

3,null,null,unarmed and finishing his breakfast
4,anger,a scowl on his brow,His face was flushed and there was a scowl on his brow
5,null,null,here
6,null,null,"   he growled
7,null,null,flinging the parchment across the table to them
8,null,null,"  See what a pack of nursery tales our jackanapes of a nephew has sent us .  "
2526 14
 (2, 5),
1,null,null,While they were doing this
2,fear,anxiously,Edmund asked anxiously
3,null,null,"  What do you think of him
4,null,null,Peter
5,null,null,"    "  Tough
6,null,null,"   said Peter
7,null,null,"  Very tough
8,null,null,I have a chance if can keep him on the hop till his weight and short wind come against him - in this hot sun too
9,null,null,To tell the truth
10,null,null,I have n't much chance else

1,fear,became the colour of cold gravy,At the sight of Aslan the cheeks of the Telmarine soldiers became the colour of cold gravy
2,null,null,their knees knocked together
3,null,null,and many fell on their faces

5,null,null,Even the Red Dwarfs
6,null,null,who knew that he came as a friend
7,null,null,stood with open mouths and could not speak .
2529 5
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,"  Oh dear
2,null,null,"   said Cor
3,null,null,"  I dont want to at all
4,sadness,sorry,And Corin - I am most dreadfully sorry
5,null,null,I never dreamed my turning up was going to chisel you out of your kingdom .  "
2530 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,"  Your royal Highness
2,null,null,"   he said
3,sadness,sorry,"  I am most truly sorry that things have come to this extremity
4,null,null,Your Highness will bear witness that it was none of our doing
5,null,null,And of course we shall be delighted to provide your Highness with shipping back to Tashbaan for the - er - treatment which Aslan has prescribed .

 (1, 1),(1, 2),
1,happiness,glad,Meanwhile at Anvard everyone was very glad that he had been disposed of before the real fun began
2,null,null,which was a grand feast held that evening on the lawn before the castle
3,null,null,with dozens of lanterns to help the moonlight
4,null,null,And the wine flowed and tales were told and jokes were cracked
5,null,null,and then silence was made and the King 's poet with two fiddlers stepped out into the middle of the circle .

1,null,null,"  Let the skies fall
2,null,null,"   shrieked Rabadash
3,null,null,"  Let the earth gape

10,null,null,that everyone had begun to laugh .

 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,"  Little lady
2,null,null,"   he said
3,null,null,"  we bid you very heartily welcome
4,null,null,If my dear wife were still alive we could make you better cheer but could not do it with a better will
5,sadness,sorry,And I am sorry that you have had misfortunes and been driven from your father 's house
6,null,null,which cannot but be a grief to you
7,null,null,My son Cor has told me about your adventures together and all your valour .  "
2534 15
 (5, 5),(5, 6),
1,null,null,"  Well
2,null,null,well
3,null,null,"   grumbled the King
4,null,null,"  we 'll pass it over for this time
5,surprise,surprised,And now - "   What came next surprised Shasta as much as anything that had ever happened to him in his life
6,null,null,He found himself suddenly embraced inn bear-like hug by King Lune and kissed on both cheeks
7,null,null,Then the King set him down again and said
8,null,null,"  Stand here together
9,null,null,boys
10,null,null,and let all the court see you
11,null,null,Hold up your heads
12,null,null,Now

 (8, 9),
1,null,null,He shook his mane and sprang forward into a great gallop - a Unicorn 's gallop
2,null,null,which
3,null,null,in our world
4,null,null,would have carried him out of sight in a few moments
5,null,null,But now a most strange thing happened
6,null,null,Everyone else began to run
7,null,null,and they found
8,surprise,to their astonishment,to their astonishment
9,null,null,that they could keep up with him :  not only the Dogs and the humans but even fat little Puzzle and short-legged Poggin the Dwarf
10,null,null,The air flew in their faces as if they were driving fast in a car without a windscreen .
2536 7
 (7, 4),(7, 6),
1,null,null,But when I watched the Tarkaan 's face
2,null,null,and marked every word that he said to the Monkey
3,null,null,then I changed my mind :  for I saw that the Tarkaan did not believe in it himself
4,null,null,And then I understood that he did not believe in Tash at all :  for if he had
5,null,null,how could he dare to mock him
6,null,null,"  When I understood this
7,anger,a great rage,a great rage fell upon me and I wondered that the true Tash did not strike down both the Monkey and the Tarkaan with fire from heaven .

 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  As soon as I had gone in at the door
2,null,null,the first wonder was that I found myself in this great sunlight ( as we all are now ) though the inside of the hovel had looked dark from outside
3,surprise,marvel,But I had no time to marvel at this
4,null,null,for immediately I was forced to fight for my head against one of our own men .

2,null,null,At last the door opened for the third time and there came in a young Calormene

4,null,null,The sentinel at the door started
5,surprise,surprised,and looked very surprised
6,null,null,when he saw him
7,null,null,I think he 'd been expecting someone quite different - "

1,null,null,"  Not very
2,null,null,"   said Edmund
3,null,null,"  It wasnt at all like that other time when we were pulled out of our own world by Magic
4,null,null,There was a frightful roar and something hit me with a bang
5,null,null,but it didnt hurt
6,null,null,And I felt not so much scared as - well
7,null,null,excited
8,null,null,Oh - and this is one queer thing
9,null,null,i 'd had a rather sore knee
10,null,null,from a hack at rugger

6,null,null,over the round belly and knee and up into the wet gap all the way to the north pole or the equator depending which way you thought you were sailing
7,null,null,working at it until she shuddered and bucked against his hand and he rolled her over
8,sadness,hated,did quickly what she hated
9,null,null,They stayed in the little apartment which he favored because it could be left at any time .

 (5, 3),
1,null,null,Late in the afternoon
2,null,null,thunder growling
3,null,null,that same old green pickup rolled in and he saw Jack get out of the truck
4,null,null,beat-up Resistol tilted back
5,happiness,A hot jolt scalded Ennis,A hot jolt scalded Ennis and he was out on the landing pulling the door closed behind him
6,null,null,Jack took the stairs two and two .

 (26, 3),
1,null,null,Late in the afternoon
2,null,null,thunder growling
3,null,null,that same old green pickup rolled in and he saw Jack get out of the truck
4,null,null,beat-up Resistol tilted back
5,null,null,A hot jolt scalded Ennis and he was out on the landing pulling the door closed behind him
6,null,null,Jack took the stairs two and two
7,null,null,They seized each other by the shoulders
8,null,null,hugged mightily
9,null,null,squeezing the breath out of each other
10,null,null,saying
11,null,null,son of a bitch
12,null,null,son of a bitch
13,null,null,then
14,null,null,and easily as the right key turns the lock tumblers
15,null,null,their mouths came together
16,null,null,and hard
17,null,null,Jack 's big teeth bringing blood
18,null,null,his hat falling to the floor
19,null,null,stubble rasping
20,null,null,wet saliva welling
21,null,null,and the door opening and Alma looking out for a few seconds at Ennis 's straining shoulders and shutting the door again and still they clinched
22,null,null,pressing chest and groin and thigh and leg together
23,null,null,treading on each other 's toes until they pulled apart to breathe and Ennis
24,null,null,not big on endearments
25,null,null,said what he said to his horses and daughters
26,happiness,little darlin,little darlin .
2725 6
 (6, 1),
1,null,null,"  I got a boy
2,null,null,"   said Jack
3,null,null,"  Eight months old
4,null,null,Tell you what
5,null,null,I married a cute little old Texas girl down in Childress   Lureen
6,fear,Jack was shaking,From the vibration of the floorboard on which they both stood Ennis could feel how hard Jack was shaking .
2726 5
 (4, 1),
1,null,null,"  I didnt know where in the hell you was
2,null,null,"   said Ennis
3,null,null,"  Four years
4,sadness,give up on you,I about give up on you
5,null,null,I figured you was sore about that punch .  "
2727 4
 (3, 3),

2,null,null,Course he dont let her have none a the money
3,disgust,hates,and he hates my fuckin guts
4,null,null,so it 's a hard go now but one a these days    "
2728 3
 (3, 1),

2,null,null,There 's no reins on this one
3,fear,scares,It scares the piss out a me .  "
2729 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He went on
2,null,null,"  Yeah
3,surprise,surprised,that little punch a yours surprised me
4,null,null,I never figured you to throw a dirty punch .  "
2730 4
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,tired,Dad got tired a me come bawling in the house and when I was about six he set me down and says
2,null,null,Ennis
3,null,null,you got a problem and you got a fix it or it 's gonna be with you until you 're ninety and K
4,null,null,'s ninety-three .
2731 2
 (1, 1),
1,disgust,resentment,Her resentment opened out a little every year :  the embrace she had glimpsed
2,null,null,Ennis 's fishing trips once or twice a year with Jack Twist and never a vacation with her and the girls .
2732 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Ennis went back to ranch work
2,null,null,hired on here and there
3,happiness,glad,not getting much ahead but glad enough to be around stock again
4,null,null,free to drop things
5,null,null,quit if he had to
6,null,null,and go into the mountains at short notice .
2733 2
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,remembered,What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close
2,null,null,the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger .
2734 6
 (1, 6),
1,sadness,The huge sadness,The huge sadness of the northern plains rolled down on him
2,null,null,He didnt know which way it was
3,null,null,the tire iron or a real accident
4,null,null,blood choking down Jack 's throat and nobody to turn him over
5,null,null,Under the wind drone he heard steel slamming off bone
6,null,null,the hollow chatter of a settling tire rim .
2735 7
 (7, 6),
1,null,null,He had been about three or four
2,null,null,he said
3,null,null,always late getting to the toilet
4,null,null,struggling with buttons
5,null,null,the seat
6,null,null,the height of the thing and often as not left the surroundings sprinkled down
7,anger,blew up,The old man blew up about it and this one time worked into a crazy rage .
2736 11
 (9, 1),
1,null,null,Around that time Jack began to appear in his dreams
2,null,null,Jack as he had first seen him
3,null,null,curly headed and smiling and bucktoothed
4,null,null,talking about getting up off his pockets and into the control zone
5,null,null,but the can of beans with the spoon handle jutting out and balanced on the log was there as well
6,null,null,in a cartoon shape and lurid colors that gave the dreams a flavor of comic obscenity
7,null,null,The spoon handle was the kind that could be used as a tire iron
8,null,null,And he would wake sometimes in grief
9,happiness,joy,sometimes with the old sense of joy and release
10,null,null,the pillow sometimes wet
11,null,null,sometimes the sheets .

2738 12
 (9, 12),
1,null,null,Sitting at Prim 's knees
2,null,null,guarding her
3,null,null,is the world 's ugliest cat
4,null,null,mashed in nose
5,null,null,half of one ear missing
6,null,null,eyes the color of rotting squash
7,null,null,Prim named him Buttercup
8,null,null,insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower
9,disgust,hates,I le hates me
10,null,null,Or at least distrusts me
11,null,null,Even though it was years ago
12,null,null,I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home .
2739 14
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,Scrawny kitten
2,null,null,belly swollen with worms
3,null,null,crawling with fleas
4,null,null,The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed
5,null,null,But Prim begged so hard
6,sadness,cried,cried even
7,null,null,I had to let him stay
8,null,null,It turned out okay
9,null,null,My mother got rid ofthe vermin and he 's a born mouser
10,null,null,Even catches the occasional rat
11,null,null,Sometimes
12,null,null,when I clean a kill
13,null,null,I feed Buttercup the entrails
14,null,null,He has stopped hissing at me .
2740 19
 (10, 10),(10, 11),
1,null,null,Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam
2,null,null,I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow
3,null,null,Separating the Meadow from the woods
4,null,null,in fact enclosing all of District 12
5,null,null,is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire loops
6,null,null,In theory
7,null,null,it 's supposed to be electrified twenty four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods  !  packs of wild dogs
8,null,null,lone cougars
9,null,null,bears  !  that used to threaten our streets
10,happiness,lucky,But since we 're lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings
11,null,null,it 's usually safe to touch
12,null,null,Even so
13,null,null,I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live
14,null,null,Right now
15,null,null,it 's silent as a stone
16,null,null,Concealed by a clump of bushes
17,null,null,I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that 's been loose for years
18,null,null,There are several other weak spots in the fence
19,null,null,but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here .
2741 14
 (6, 6),(6, 7),(6, 8),
1,null,null,As soon as im in the trees
2,null,null,I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log
3,null,null,Electrified or not
4,null,null,the fence  has been successful at keeping the flesh eaters out of District 12
5,null,null,Inside the woods they roam freely
6,fear,added concerns,and there are added concerns like venomous snakes
7,null,null,rabid animals
8,null,null,and no real paths to follow
9,null,null,But there 's also food if you know how to find it
10,null,null,My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion
11,null,null,There was nothing even to bury
12,null,null,I was eleven then
13,null,null,Five years later
14,null,null,I still wake up screaming for him to run .
2742 6
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poach ing carries the severest of penalties
2,fear,risk,more people would risk it if they had weapons
3,null,null,But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife
4,null,null,My bow is a rarity
5,null,null,crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods
6,null,null,carefully wrapped in waterproof covers .
2743 7
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,When I was younger
2,fear,scared,I scared my mother to death
3,null,null,the things I would blurt out about District 12
4,null,null,about the people who rule our country
5,null,null,Panem
6,null,null,from the far-off city called the Capitol
7,null,null,Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble .
2744 8
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself
2,null,null,Gale
3,happiness,relaxing,I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing
4,null,null,my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place
5,null,null,a rock ledge overlooking a valley
6,null,null,A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes
7,null,null,The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile
8,null,null,Gale says I never smile except in the woods .

3,null,null,I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing

8,null,null,Gale says I never smile except in the woods .
2746 12
 (11, 10),
1,null,null,"  Hey
2,null,null,Catnip
3,null,null,"   says Gale
4,null,null,My real name is Katniss
5,null,null,but when I first told him
6,null,null,I had barely whispered it
7,null,null,So he thought i 'd said Catnip
8,null,null,Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts
9,null,null,it became his official nickname for me
10,null,null,I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game
11,sadness,regretted,I almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company
12,null,null,But I got a decent price for his pelt .
2747 11
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,"  Look what I shot
2,null,null,"   Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it
3,happiness,laugh,and I laugh
4,null,null,It 's real bakery bread
5,null,null,not the flat
6,null,null,dense loaves we make from our grain rations
7,null,null,I take it in my hands
8,null,null,pull out the arrow
9,null,null,and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose
10,null,null,inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva
11,null,null,Fine bread like this is for special occasions .
2748 9
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Besides
2,null,null,if he wants kids
3,null,null,Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife
4,null,null,He 's good-looking
5,null,null,he 's strong enough to handle the work in the mines
6,null,null,and he can hunt
7,null,null,You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him
8,disgust,jealous,It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think
9,null,null,Good hunting partners are hard to find .
2749 8
 (3, 5),
1,null,null,Tonight
2,null,null,After the reaping
3,happiness,celebrate,everyone is supposed to celebrate
4,null,null,And a lot of people do
5,null,null,out of relief that their children have been spared for another year
6,null,null,But at least two families will pull their shutters
7,null,null,lock their doors
8,null,null,and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come .
2750 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected
2,null,null,On other days
3,null,null,deep in the woods
4,disgust,rant,i 've listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district
5,null,null,A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another
6,null,null,"  It 's to the Capitol 's advantage to have us divided among ourselves
7,null,null,"   he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine
8,null,null,If it wasnt reaping day
9,null,null,If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what im sure she thought was a harmless comment .
2751 10
 (9, 10),
1,null,null,"  And nothing like myself
2,null,null,"   I say
3,null,null,I hug her
4,null,null,because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her
5,null,null,Her first reaping
6,null,null,She 's about as safe as you can get
7,null,null,since she 's only entered once
8,null,null,I would n't let her take out any tesserae
9,fear,worried,But she 's worried about me
10,null,null,That the unthinkable might happen .
2752 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,I protect Prim in every way I can
2,null,null,but im powerless against the reaping
3,sadness,anguish,The anguish I always feel when she 's in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ( ace
4,null,null,I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm
5,null,null,"  Tuck your tail in
6,null,null,little duck
7,null,null,"   I say
8,null,null,smoothing the blouse back in place .
2753 7
 (7, 1),
1,null,null,Prim giggles and gives me a small  "  Quack
2,null,null,Quack yourself
3,null,null,"   I say with a light laugh
4,null,null,The kind only Prim can draw out of me
5,null,null,"  Come on
6,null,null,let 's eat
7,happiness,plant,"   I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head .
2754 13
 (1, 3),
1,sadness,bad,It 's too bad
2,null,null,really
3,null,null,that they hold the reaping in the square !  one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant
4,null,null,The square 's surrounded by shops
5,null,null,and on public market days
6,null,null,especially if there 's good weather
7,null,null,it has a holiday feel to it
8,null,null,But today
9,null,null,despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings
10,null,null,there 's an air of grimness
11,null,null,The camera crews
12,null,null,perched like buzzards on rooftops
13,null,null,only add to the effect .
2755 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The space gets tighter
2,fear,claustrophobic,more claustrophobic as people ar rive
3,null,null,The square 's quite large
4,null,null,but not enough to hold District 12 's population of about eight thousand
5,null,null,Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets
6,null,null,where they can watch the event on screens as it 's televised live by the state .
2756 9
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,Through the crowd
2,null,null,I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile
3,null,null,As reaping s go
4,happiness,entertainment,this one at least has a slight entertainment factor
5,null,null,But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor
6,null,null,Not compared to a lot of the boys
7,null,null,And maybe he 's thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away
8,null,null,"  But there are still thousands of slips
9,null,null,"   I wish I could whisper to him .
2757 11
 (8, 1),
1,null,null,It 's time for the drawing
2,null,null,Effie Trinket says as she always does
3,null,null,"  Ladies first
4,null,null,"   and crosses to the glass ball with the girls ' names
5,null,null,She reaches in
6,null,null,digs her hand deep into the ball
7,null,null,and pulls out a slip of paper
8,fear,collective breath,The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop
9,null,null,and im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it 's not me
10,null,null,that it 's not me
11,null,null,that it 's not me .
2758 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,That 's how I feel now
2,null,null,trying to remember how to breathe
3,null,null,unable to speak
4,surprise,stunned,totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull
5,null,null,Someone is gripping my arm
6,null,null,a boy from the Seam
7,null,null,and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me .
2759 11
 (2, 10),
1,null,null,There must have been some mistake
2,surprise,This cant be happening,This cant be happening
3,null,null,Prim was one slip of paper in thousands
4,null,null,Her chances of being chosen so remote that i 'd not even bothered to worry about her
5,null,null,had not I done everything
6,null,null,Taken the tesserae
7,null,null,refused to let her do the same
8,null,null,One slip
9,null,null,One slip in thousands
10,null,null,The odds had been entirely in her favor
11,null,null,But it had not mattered .
2760 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Somewhere far away
2,sadness,un happily,I can hear the crowd murmuring un happily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair
3,null,null,And then I see her
4,null,null,the blood drained from her face
5,null,null,hands clenched in fists at her sides
6,null,null,walking with stiff
7,null,null,small steps up toward the stage
8,null,null,passing me
9,null,null,and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt
10,null,null,It 's this detail
11,null,null,the untucked blouse forming a ducktail
12,null,null,that brings me back to myself .

1,happiness,Lovely,"  Lovely
2,null,null,"   says Effie Trinket
3,null,null,"  But I believe there 's a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers
4,null,null,and if one does come forth then we
5,null,null,um

2,null,null,Look at this one

4,null,null,throwing an arm around my shoulders
5,null,null,He 's surprisingly strong for such a wreck
6,null,null,"  I like her
7,null,null,"   His breath reeks of liquor and it 's been a long time since he 's bathed
8,null,null,"  Lots of
9,null,null,"   He cant think of the word for a while
10,null,null,"  Spunk
11,null,null,"   he says triumphantly
12,null,null,"  More than you
13,null,null,"   he releases me and starts for the front of the stage
14,null,null,"  More than you
15,null,null,"   he shouts
16,null,null,pointing directly into a camera
17,null,null,he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol
18,null,null,i 'll never know because just ashe 's opening his mouth to continue
19,null,null,Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious

5,null,null,which has listed severely to the right
6,happiness,more excitement,"  But more excitement to come
7,null,null,It 's time to choose our boy tribute
8,null,null,"   Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation
9,null,null,she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys ' names and grabs the first slip she encounters
10,null,null,She zips back to the podium
11,null,null,and I dont even have time to wish for Gale 's safety when she 's reading the name

2771 5
 (5, 4),

3,null,null,The words were ugly and I had no defense
4,null,null,As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away
5,null,null,I noticed him

11,null,null,she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return
12,null,null,We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife is n't around because he 's so much nicer
13,null,null,I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread
