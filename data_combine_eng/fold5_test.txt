2,null,null,my lord
3,null,null,"   he cried
4,null,null,turning to the chief of police
5,null,null,"  how nearly have you caused the death of three innocent people
6,null,null,But if you will only have the patience to listen to my tale
7,null,null,you shall know who is the real culprit
8,null,null,If some one has to suffer
9,null,null,it must be me
10,null,null,Yesterday
11,null,null,at dusk
12,null,null,I was working in my shop with a light heart when the little hunchback
13,null,null,who was more than half drunk
14,null,null,came and sat in the doorway
15,null,null,He sang me several songs
16,null,null,and then I invited him to finish the evening at my house
17,null,null,He accepted my invitation
18,null,null,and we went away together
19,null,null,At supper I helped him to a slice of fish
20,null,null,but in eating it a bone stuck in his throat
21,null,null,and in spite of all we could do he died in a few minutes
22,null,null,We felt deeply sorry for his death
23,fear,fearing,but fearing lest we should be held responsible
24,null,null,we carried the corpse to the house of the Jewish doctor
25,null,null,I knocked
26,null,null,and desired the servant to beg her master to come down as fast as possible and see a sick man whom we had brought for him to cure
27,null,null,and in order to hasten his movements I placed a piece of money in her hand as the doctor 's fee
28,null,null,Directly she had disappeared I dragged the body to the top of the stairs
29,null,null,and then hurried away with my wife back to our house
30,null,null,In descending the stairs the doctor accidentally knocked over the corpse
31,null,null,and finding him dead believed that he himself was the murderer
32,null,null,But now you know the truth set him free
33,null,null,and let me die in his stead .  "

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,grief,At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain
2,null,null,I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow
3,null,null,Then
4,null,null,fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father
5,null,null,I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase
6,null,null,and quitting the underground chamber
7,null,null,made everything fast as before .
1149 7
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,excited,His words excited my curiosity to the highest pitch
2,null,null,"  Make trial on me
3,null,null,I implore you
4,null,null,"   I cried
5,null,null,holding out the box to the dervish

7,null,null,I am burning with impatience to test its charms .  "

1,null,null,The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not ta accept the explanation offered by Prince Firouz Schah
2,null,null,but she was much disturbed at his intention of departing at once
3,null,null,for she feared that
4,null,null,no sooner had he left her
5,null,null,than the impression she had made on him would fade away
6,null,null,So she made one more effort to keep him
7,fear,anxiety,and after assuring him that she entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father
8,null,null,begged him to give her a day or two more of his company .
1153 33
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,When the dervish saw that the prince 's mind was made up
2,null,null,he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him
3,null,null,and held it out
4,null,null,"  If it must be so
5,null,null,"   he said
6,null,null,with a sigh
7,null,null,"  take this
8,null,null,and when you have mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you
9,null,null,It will roll on till it reaches the foot of a mountain
10,null,null,and when it stops you will stop also
11,fear,fear,You will then throw the bridle on your horse 's neck without any fear of his straying
12,null,null,and will dismount
13,null,null,On each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones
14,null,null,and will hear a multitude of insulting voices
15,null,null,but pay no heed to them
16,null,null,and
17,null,null,above all
18,null,null,beware of ever turning your head
19,null,null,If you do
20,null,null,you will instantly become a black stone like the rest
21,null,null,For those stones are in reality men like yourself
22,null,null,who have been on the same quest
23,null,null,and have failed
24,null,null,as I fear that you may fail also
25,null,null,If you manage to avoid this pitfall
26,null,null,and to reach the top of the mountain
27,null,null,you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage
28,null,null,and you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water
29,null,null,That is all I have to say
30,null,null,You know what you have to do
31,null,null,and what to avoid
32,null,null,but if you are wise you will think of it no more
33,null,null,but return whence you have come .  "

1,null,null,The Cowperwoods
2,null,null,father and mother
3,null,null,were not so lean and narrow that they could not enter into the natural tendency to be happy and joyous with their children
4,null,null,and so this family
5,null,null,which increased at the rate of a child every two or three years after Frank 's birth until there were four children
6,happiness,interesting,was quite an interesting affair when he was ten and they were ready to move into the New Market Street home
7,null,null,Henry Worthington Cowperwood 's connections were increased as his position grew more responsible
8,null,null,and gradually he was becoming quite a personage .
1163 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,In this progress of his father young Cowperwood definitely shared
2,null,null,He was quite often allowed to come to the bank on Saturdays
3,happiness,great interest,when he would watch with great interest the deft exchange of bills at the brokerage end of the business
4,null,null,He wanted to know where all the types of money came from
5,null,null,why discounts were demanded and received
6,null,null,what the men did with all the money they received .
1173 4
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,The appearance of Frank Cowperwood at this time was
2,null,null,to say the least
3,happiness,pre possessing,pre possessing and satisfactory
4,null,null,Nature had destined him to be about five feet ten inches tall .
1184 7
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,It was only two weeks later that Frank took his departure from Waterman & Company
2,null,null,interested and yet in no way flustered by his new prospects
3,sadness,grief,And great was the grief of Mr
4,null,null,George Waterman
5,null,null,As for Mr
6,null,null,Henry Waterman
7,null,null,he was actually irritated by this defection .
1194 16
 (9, 12),
1,null,null,At first
2,null,null,when Frank called
3,null,null,she did not have much to say
4,null,null,She was gracious
5,null,null,but the burden of conversation fell on her husband
6,null,null,Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time
7,null,null,and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something
8,null,null,Fortunately she was not
9,happiness,pleasantly,Semple talked to him pleasantly
10,null,null,because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant
11,null,null,was suave and ingratiating
12,null,null,and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line
13,null,null,One spring evening they sat on the porch and talked nothing very important slavery
14,null,null,street cars
15,null,null,the panic it was on then
16,null,null,that of 1857 the development of the West .
1200 18
 (14, 13),
1,null,null,During all these days young Cowperwood was following these financial complications with interest
2,null,null,He was not disturbed by the cause of slavery
3,null,null,or the talk of secession
4,null,null,or the general progress or decline of the country
5,null,null,except in so far as it affected his immediate interests
6,null,null,He longed to become a stable financier
7,null,null,but
8,null,null,now that he saw the inside of the brokerage business
9,null,null,he was not so sure that he wanted to stay in it
10,null,null,Gambling in stocks
11,null,null,according to conditions produced by this panic
12,null,null,seemed very hazardous
13,null,null,A number of brokers failed
14,sadness,anguished faces,He saw them rush in to Tighe with anguished faces and ask that certain trades be canceled
15,null,null,Their very homes were in danger
16,null,null,they said
17,null,null,They would be wiped out
18,null,null,their wives and children put out on the street .
1206 12
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,"  Oh
2,sadness,sighed,"   she sighed
3,null,null,falling limp on his shoulder when he refused to let her go
4,null,null,Then
5,null,null,because of the set determination of his face
6,null,null,some intense pull in him
7,null,null,she smiled
8,null,null,"  How would I ever explain if I did marry you
9,null,null,"   she asked
10,null,null,weakly
11,null,null,"  Your father

1,null,null,Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood at this time was thirty-two years old
3,null,null,Cowperwood twenty-seven
4,null,null,The birth and care of two children had made some difference in her looks
5,null,null,She was no longer as softly pleasing
6,null,null,more angular
7,null,null,Her face was hollow cheeked
8,null,null,like so many of Rossetti 's and Burne-Jones 's women
9,null,null,Her health was really not as good as it had been the care of two children and a late undiagnosed tendency toward gastritis having reduced her
10,sadness,suffered from fits of depression,In short she was a little run down nervously and suffered from fits of depression
11,null,null,Cowperwood had noticed this
12,null,null,He tried to be gentle and considerate
13,null,null,but he was too much of a utilitarian and practical minded observer not to realize that he was likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later .

5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him
8,null,null,So he had gone his way day by day

1,fear,gripped her,But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her
2,null,null,and when she sat at the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before her mirror
3,null,null,she was conscious of her figure
4,null,null,her charms
5,null,null,what they meant to men
6,null,null,how women envied her
7,null,null,Sometimes she looked at poor
8,null,null,hollow chested or homely faced girls and felt sorry for them
9,null,null,at other times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically .

1,happiness,interested him greatly,There was one line being laid out to within a few blocks of his new home the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line it was called  which interested him greatly
2,null,null,He rode on it occasionally when he was delayed or did not wish to trouble about a vehicle
3,null,null,It ran through two thriving streets of red-brick houses
4,null,null,and was destined to have a great future once the city grew large enough
5,null,null,As yet it was really not long enough .

 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Butler was sorry that he had called his youngest a baggage
2,disgust,annoyance,but these children God bless his soul were a great annoyance

4,null,null,in the name of all the saints
5,null,null,wasnt this house good enough for them

 (6, 8),
1,null,null,"  Well

 (25, 22),
1,null,null,She had stood before her mirror between eight and nine it was nine fifteen before she was really ready and pondered over what she should wear
2,null,null,There were two tall pier glasses in her wardrobe  an unduly large piece of furniture and one in her closet door
3,null,null,She stood before the latter
4,null,null,looking at her bare arms and shoulders
5,null,null,her shapely figure
6,null,null,thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple
7,null,null,and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles
8,null,null,The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first
9,null,null,and she chided her maid
10,null,null,Kathleen Kelly
11,null,null,She studied how to arrange her hair
12,null,null,and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted
13,null,null,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,null,null,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,null,null,Finally
16,null,null,she found one size and one place that suited her
17,null,null,She turned her head from side to side
18,null,null,looking at the combined effect of her hair
19,null,null,her penciled brows
20,null,null,her dimpled shoulder
21,null,null,and the black beauty spot
22,null,null,If some one man could see her as she was now
23,null,null,some time
24,null,null,Which man
25,fear,frightened,That thought scurried back like a frightened rat into its hole
26,null,null,She was

1,null,null,And as for safeguards against the production of new life they were not mysteries to him any longer
2,null,null,He knew all about them
3,null,null,Care was the point of caution
4,fear,cautious,He had to be cautious
5,null,null,for he was so rapidly coming to be an influential and a distinguished man
6,null,null,Aileen
7,null,null,of course
8,null,null,was not conscious
9,null,null,except in a vague way
10,null,null,of the drift of her passion
11,null,null,the ultimate destiny to which this affection might lead was not clear to her
12,null,null,Her craving was for love to be fondled and caressed and she really did not think so much further
13,null,null,Further thoughts along this line were like rats that showed their heads out of dark holes in shadowy corners and scuttled back at the least sound
14,null,null,And
15,null,null,anyhow
16,null,null,all that was to be connected with Cowperwood would be beautiful
17,null,null,She really did not think that he loved her yet as he should
18,null,null,but he would
19,null,null,She did not know that she wanted to interfere with the claims of his wife
20,null,null,She did not think she did
21,null,null,But it would not hurt Mrs
22,null,null,Cowperwood if Frank loved her Aileen also .

 (3, 1),
1,null,null,Things had changed considerably for him since the days when he had been fortuitously and almost indifferently made city treasurer
2,null,null,His method of dressing had so much improved since he had been inducted into office
3,happiness,good feeling,and his manner expressed so much more good feeling
4,null,null,confidence
5,null,null,aplomb
6,null,null,that he would not have recognized himself if he had been permitted to see himself as had those who had known him before .
1305 26
 (24, 17),(24, 18),
1,null,null,His one pet idea
2,null,null,the thing he put more faith in than anything else
3,null,null,was his street railway manipulations
4,null,null,and particularly his actual control of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line
5,null,null,Through an advance to him
6,null,null,on deposit
7,null,null,made in his bank by Stener at a time when the stock of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line was at a low ebb
8,null,null,he had managed to pick up fifty-one per cent
9,null,null,of the stock for himself and Stener
10,null,null,by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road
11,null,null,To accomplish this
12,null,null,however
13,null,null,he had resorted to some very  "  peculiar "   methods
14,null,null,as they afterward came to be termed in financial circles
15,null,null,to get this stock at his own valuation
16,null,null,Through agents he caused suits for damages to be brought against the company for non-payment of interest due
17,null,null,A little stock in the hands of a hireling
18,null,null,a request made to a court of record to examine the books of the company in order to determine whether a receivership were not advisable

24,fear,frightened,brought the frightened stockholders into the market with their holdings
25,null,null,The banks considered the line a poor risk
26,null,null,and called their loans in connection with it .
1307 13
 (13, 12),
1,null,null,However
2,null,null,by the spring and summer of 1871
3,null,null,Cowperwood had actually
4,null,null,without being in any conceivable danger from any source
5,null,null,spread himself out very thin
6,null,null,Because of his great success he had grown more liberal easier in his financial ventures
7,null,null,By degrees
8,null,null,and largely because of his own confidence in himself
9,null,null,he had induced his father to enter upon his street car speculations
10,null,null,to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary
11,null,null,In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical
12,null,null,but as time had worn on and nothing but profit eventuated
13,happiness,bolder,he grew bolder and more confident .

7,happiness,glory,She was actually beside herself at times with the glory
8,null,null,as well as the delight of all this .
1320 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He hurried down the street to various bankers and brokers suggesting that they do this close the exchange
2,null,null,At a few minutes before twelve o'clock he drove rapidly to the station to meet Stener
3,sadness,great disappointment,but to his great disappointment the latter did not arrive
4,null,null,It looked as though he had missed his train
5,null,null,Cowperwood sensed something
6,null,null,some trick
7,null,null,and decided to go to the city hall and also to Stener 's house
8,null,null,Perhaps he had returned and was trying to avoid him .
1321 12
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Stener
2,null,null,as he saw him now
3,null,null,was a pawn in whosoever 's hands he happened to be at the time
4,null,null,and despite Mr
5,null,null,Mollenhauer and Mr
6,null,null,Simpson and Mr
7,null,null,Butler he proposed to attempt to keep him in his own hands if possible
8,null,null,And so he stood there looking at him as might a snake at a bird determined to galvanize him into selfish self interest if possible
9,fear,so frightened,But Stener was so frightened that at the moment it looked as though there was little to be done with him
10,null,null,His face was a grayish blue :  his eyelids and eye rings puffy and his hands and lips moist
11,null,null,God
12,null,null,what a hole he was in now
1329 7
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,That was why he had been so ready to let Cowperwood act for him
2,null,null,and now
3,null,null,when he should have seen more clearly than ever the significance of what Cowperwood was proposing
4,fear,frightened,he was frightened and his reason obscured by such things as Mollenhauer 's probable opposition and rage
5,null,null,Cowperwood 's possible failure
6,null,null,his own inability to face a real crisis
7,null,null,Cowperwood 's innate financial ability did not reassure Stener in this hour .

1,null,null,However
2,sadness,painfully,the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident

6,null,null,in the presence of all hands

1,null,null,We saw none

4,fear,scared,so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent
5,null,null,I hope I shall be excused  .  Remembering
6,null,null,however
7,null,null,that all our lives depended on keeping cool
8,null,null,I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces
9,null,null,but compel myself to think and act calmly
10,null,null,since I was responsible for others If the animal had not been in so blind a fury
