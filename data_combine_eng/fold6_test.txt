10,null,null,staring at his sister in irritation

5,null,null,He had discovered something during his exploration
6,null,null,and now that he was finally talking to one of the people on the other side of the fence it seemed like a good idea to make the most of the opportunity .

7,fear,thrilling,It was a thrilling sentiment

5,null,null,when a few days later he was introduced to City Treasurer Julian Bode

7,null,null,"  Of course
8,null,null,you know

13,null,null,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,null,null,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,null,null,Finally

5,null,null,a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss and illumined as far as the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas lamps placed at regular intervals
6,null,null,as in the thoroughfare of a great city

10,null,null,' you dont have any choice

13,fear,horrible,At first it felt horrible putting his bare feet into so much mud
14,null,null,they sank down to his ankles and every time he lifted a foot it felt worse .

1,null,null,Well
2,null,null,i 've tried to say  "  HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE
3,null,null,"   but it all came different

5,null,null,repeat
6,null,null,"  YOU ARE OLD
7,null,null,FATHER WILLIAM
8,null,null,"  ' said the Caterpillar  .  Alice folded her hands
9,null,null,and began :  You are old
10,null,null,Father William
11,null,null,' the young man said
12,null,null,And your hair has become very white
13,null,null,And yet you incessantly stand on your head  Do you think

21,null,null,Why
22,null,null,I do it again and again
23,null,null,You are old
24,null,null,' said the youth
25,null,null,as I mentioned before
26,null,null,And have grown most uncommonly fat
27,null,null,Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door  Pray
28,null,null,what is the reason of that
29,null,null,'  In my youth
30,null,null,' said the sage
31,null,null,as he shook his grey locks
32,null,null,I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box  Allow me to sell you a couple
33,null,null,'  You are old

1,null,null,Let me alone
2,null,null,'  Serpent
3,null,null,I say again
4,null,null,' repeated the Pigeon
5,null,null,but in a more subdued tone
6,null,null,and added with a kind of sob
7,null,null,i 've tried every way
8,null,null,and nothing seems to suit them
9,null,null,'  I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about
10,null,null,' said Alice

14,null,null,' the Pigeon went on
15,null,null,without attending to her
16,null,null,but those serpents
17,null,null,There 's no pleasing them
18,null,null,' Alice was more and more puzzled
19,null,null,but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs
20,null,null,' said the Pigeon
21,null,null,but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day
22,null,null,Why
23,null,null,I have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
24,disgust,annoyed,' im very sorry you 've been annoyed
25,null,null,' said Alice
26,null,null,who was beginning to see its meaning And just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood
27,null,null,' continued the Pigeon
28,null,null,raising its voice to a shriek
29,null,null,and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last
30,null,null,they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
31,null,null,Ugh
32,null,null,Serpent

1,null,null,' kinsman
2,null,null,' thought Malcolm
3,null,null,' do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal
4,null,null,' but then
5,null,null,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,null,null,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,null,null,and so kind to himself
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,null,null,dismounted
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,as John said
13,null,null,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,null,null,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,null,null,sheltered from the wind
16,null,null,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,null,null,dried fish
18,null,null,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,null,null,in a bright warm sunshine
20,null,null,and Hal
21,null,null,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,null,null,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,null,null,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,null,null,seated himself on the grass
25,surprise,surprise,and to Malcolm 's extreme surprise
26,null,null,not to say disgust
27,null,null,was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap .
2090 13
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Yet he was reluctant to break with the old habits that had hitherto been part of his nature
2,null,null,he felt
3,null,null,after every word of Esclairmonde nay
4,null,null,after every glance towards her as though it were a blessed thing to have
5,null,null,like her
6,null,null,chosen the better part
7,null,null,he knew she would approve his resort to the home of piety and learning
8,sadness,ashamed,he was aware that when with Ralf Percy and the other youths of the Court he was ashamed of his own scrupulousness
9,null,null,and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and unmanly
10,null,null,and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic might not seize him and disgrace him for ever
11,null,null,In effect he did not know what he wished
12,null,null,even when he found that the Queen had decided against going across the sea
13,null,null,and that therefore all the ladies would remain with her at Shene or Windsor .
2094 22
 (19, 19),
1,null,null,To this the deputies consented
2,null,null,and the next day was fixed for the surrender
3,null,null,The difficulty was
4,null,null,as Henry had found at Harfleur
5,null,null,Rouen
6,null,null,and many other places
7,null,null,to enforce forbearance on his soldiery
8,null,null,who regarded plunder as their lawful prey
9,null,null,the enemy as their natural game
10,null,null,and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmerciful ness
11,null,null,The more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of English country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of men-at-arms
12,null,null,the mere greedy
13,null,null,rapacious
14,null,null,and insubordinate became their temper
15,null,null,Well knowing the greatness of the peril
16,null,null,and that the very best of his captains had scarcely the will
17,null,null,if they had the power
18,null,null,to restrain the license that soon became barbarity unimaginable
19,sadness,sadly,he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender
20,null,null,when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his escutcheon
21,null,null,but a shame to human nature
22,null,null,looking back to the exultation with which he had entered Harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness .

 (22, 22),
1,null,null,Much of his time was spent on the child
2,null,null,whose chief nurse and playmate he had been throughout her malady
3,null,null,and when she showed him the stranger 's arrangements
4,null,null,or repeated to him
5,null,null,in a wondering
6,null,null,blundering way
7,null,null,with constant appeals to her attendant
8,null,null,the new tales she had heard
9,null,null,he used to listen with a pleased awkward amazement at his little Ermentrude 's astonishing cleverness
10,null,null,joined sometimes with real interest
11,null,null,which was evinced by his inquiries of Christina
12,null,null,He certainly did not admire the little
13,null,null,slight
14,null,null,pale bower maiden
15,null,null,but he seemed to look upon her like some strange
16,null,null,almost uncanny
17,null,null,wise spirit out of some other sphere
18,null,null,and his manner towards her had none of the offensive freedom apparent in even the old man 's patronage
19,null,null,It was
20,null,null,as Ermentrude once said
21,null,null,laughing
22,fear,feared,almost as if he feared that she might do something to him .

5,null,null,not conceiving how he had offended the Prince
6,null,null,Yet recollecting  himself
7,null,null,with a mixture of grace and humility
8,null,null,he disengaged himself  from Manfred 's grip
9,null,null,and then with an obeisance
10,null,null,which discovered more  jealousy of innocence than dismay
11,null,null,he asked
12,null,null,with respect
13,null,null,of what he  was guilty
14,null,null,Manfred
15,null,null,more enraged at the vigour
16,null,null,however decently  exerted
17,null,null,with which the young man had shaken off his hold
18,null,null,than  appeased by his submission
19,null,null,ordered his attendants to seize him
20,null,null,and
21,null,null,if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the  nuptials
22,null,null,would have poignarded the peasant in their arms .
