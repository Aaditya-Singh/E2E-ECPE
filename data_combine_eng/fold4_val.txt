4,sadness,ashamed,to say I felt quite ashamed of their being so few and so poor

2,null,null,and soon saw some huts
3,null,null,to which we directed our steps
4,null,null,As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us
5,null,null,and we were led to their houses
6,null,null,and as it were divided among our captors
7,null,null,I with five others was taken into a hut
8,null,null,where we were made to sit upon the ground
9,null,null,and certain herbs were given to us
10,null,null,which the blacks made signs to us to eat
11,null,null,Observing that they themselves did not touch them
12,null,null,I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion
13,null,null,but my companions
14,null,null,being very hungry
15,null,null,rashly ate up all that was set before them
16,null,null,and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad
17,null,null,Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said
18,null,null,nor did they heed when I spoke to them
19,null,null,The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil
20,null,null,of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly
21,null,null,but I only tasted a few grains
22,null,null,understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating
23,null,null,and this was exactly what happened
24,null,null,My unlucky companions having lost their reason
25,null,null,felt neither anxiety nor fear
26,null,null,and ate greedily all that was offered them
27,null,null,So they were soon fat and there was an end of them
28,null,null,but I grew leaner day by day
29,null,null,for I ate but little

31,null,null,However
32,null,null,as I was so far from being a tempting morsel
33,null,null,I was allowed to wander about freely
34,null,null,and one day
35,null,null,when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me
36,null,null,I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest

1,null,null,All this was very fascinating to Maggie who was of a practical mind with regard to the facts immediately before her but had beyond them a lively imagination
2,sadness,lonely,Her life had been so lonely
3,null,null,spent for the most part so far from children of her own age
4,null,null,that she had no test of reality
5,null,null,She did not see any reason why the Lord God should not come again and she saw every reason why her aunts should condemn her uncle .

1,null,null,There was no one to help her
2,null,null,She was alone
3,surprise,in the shock,and it seemed to her that in the shock of that discovery she realised that she would always be alone now
4,null,null,for the rest of her life .

 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thus her aunt found her
2,null,null,later in the evening
3,null,null,She was touched by the figure
4,null,null,the shabby black frock
5,null,null,the white tired face
6,sadness,disappointed,She had been honestly disappointed in her niece
7,null,null,disappointed in her plainness
8,null,null,in her apparent want of heart

5,null,null,He smiled
6,null,null,and would have certainly been very agreeable to her had not Aunt Anne
7,null,null,who had been finding their boxes and securing a cab
8,null,null,arrived and taken Maggie away .

1,null,null,Maggie fancied that the three persons were nervous of her aunt
2,happiness,amused,the stout young man was amused perhaps at the general situation
3,null,null,but Mr

5,null,null,the colour mounting into his high bony cheeks and his nostrils twitching like a horse 's .
919 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,His voice was of an extreme kindliness and his eyes
2,null,null,when she looked up at him
3,null,null,shone with friendliness
4,null,null,She found herself
5,surprise,surprise,to her own surprise
6,null,null,talking to him with great ease
7,null,null,He was perfectly simple
8,null,null,human and unaffected
9,null,null,He asked her about her country .
933 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Her attitude was one of surprised excitement
2,surprise,amazed,She was amazed by the most ordinary incidents and conversations
3,null,null,She found Maggie 's life quite incredible .
943 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,What was there then in Maggie that started up in rebellion at this unexpected declaration
2,null,null,She had been sitting there
3,null,null,tranquil
4,happiness,happy,soothed with a happy sense that her new life was developing securely for her in the way that she would have it
5,null,null,Suddenly she was alert

2,null,null,Mathew
3,null,null,You never told us
4,null,null,I would have hurried back

1,null,null,One of the most interesting human beings whom he had ever met
2,null,null,simply because she was utterly unlike any one else
3,sadness,shame,He felt shame before her
4,null,null,because he knew that she would believe every word that he said
5,null,null,In that she was simple
6,null,null,but  "  he would be bothered if she was simple in anything else .  "

1,null,null,She loved Martin and Martin loved her
2,null,null,Soon Martin would marry her and they would go away
3,null,null,Her aunt would be sorry of course
4,null,null,and his father
5,null,null,perhaps
6,null,null,would be angry
7,anger,anger,but the sorrow and anger would be only for a little while
8,null,null,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people
9,null,null,and her own standard of fidelity and trust was
10,null,null,she supposed
11,null,null,also his .
964 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,She had hoped that he would be there
2,null,null,waiting
3,null,null,so that he might have a word with her before they went in
4,sadness,disappointment,but when they were all gathered together under the porch she saw with a throb of disappointment that he was not there
5,null,null,She saw no one whom she knew
6,null,null,but it struck her at once that here was a gathering quite different from that of the first time that she had come to the Chapel .
965 13
 (10, 3),(10, 5),(10, 6),(10, 7),(10, 8),(10, 9),
1,null,null,There seemed to be more of the servant class
2,null,null,rather they were older women with serious rapt expressions and very silent
3,null,null,There were men too
4,null,null,to-night
5,null,null,four or five gathered together inside the passage
6,null,null,standing gravely
7,null,null,without a word
8,null,null,not moving
9,null,null,like statues
10,fear,frightened,Maggie was frightened
11,null,null,She felt like a spy in an enemy 's camp
12,null,null,and a spy waiting for an inevitable detection
13,null,null,with no hope of securing any news .
969 7
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,She set back her shoulders
2,null,null,sat up stiffly
3,null,null,and tried to look as old as she might  that was not
4,null,null,unhappily
5,null,null,very old
6,happiness,happy,That smile exchanged with Martin had made her happy for ever
7,null,null,Miss Avies was of less than no importance at all

2,null,null,dear
3,null,null,to come
4,sadness,ashamed,I felt ashamed to wake you up at such an hour
5,null,null,but I wanted you
6,null,null,I felt that only you must be with me to-night
7,null,null,It was a call from God
8,null,null,I felt that it must be obeyed
9,null,null,Sit down

11,null,null,There
12,null,null,on that chair
13,null,null,you 're not cold

 (1, 1),
1,fear,panic,In a panic at these thoughts
2,null,null,and feeling as though some one was trying to push her down into a coffin whilst she was still alive
3,null,null,she began hurriedly to speak
4,null,null,although she did not know whether her aunt were asleep or no .
1006 4
 (2, 3),(4, 3),
1,null,null,Maggie told her about the visit
2,surprise,curiously,Aunt Anne looked at her curiously
3,null,null,She seemed so weak and frail that Maggie suddenly felt warm maternal love
4,surprise,shyly,Rather shyly she put her hand upon her aunt 's :   "  I wont go away until you 're better  "
1024 4
 (1, 1),
1,happiness,happiness,It was as though they both inwardly realised that there was trouble for them of every kind waiting outside and that they could only definitely realise their happiness by building a wall around themselves
2,null,null,They knew perhaps in their secret hearts
3,null,null,or at any rate Martin knew
4,null,null,that they could not hold their castle for long .
1052 11
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,Martin
2,null,null,dear
3,null,null,try and write every day
4,null,null,even if it 's only the shortest line
5,null,null,because it is dreadful to be shut up all day
6,null,null,and I think of you all the time and wonder how you are
7,null,null,dont be unhappy
8,anger,I could n't bear,Martin that 's the one thing I could n't bear
9,null,null,If you 're not
10,null,null,im not
11,null,null,There 's no reason to be unhappy about me .
1053 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,You know me better than any of them do and I am just as you know me
2,null,null,every bit
3,anger,angry,The aunts are very angry because they say I deceived them
4,null,null,but they have n't any right to tell me who I shall love
5,null,null,have they
6,null,null,No one has
7,null,null,I am myself and nobody 's ever cared for me except you and Uncle Mathew
8,null,null,so I dont see why I should think of anybody .
1056 4
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,"  But if you go on like this youll be so that you cant go on any longer
2,sadness,break down,youll break down
3,null,null,You know what the doctor said about your heart
4,null,null,You are n't taking any care at all .  "
1072 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,When she saw him she stood speechless where she was
2,fear,terrified,The change in him terrified her so that her heart seemed to leap into her throat choking her
3,null,null,The colour had drained from his face
4,null,null,leaving it dry and yellow
5,null,null,He had an amazing resemblance to his father
6,null,null,his eyes had exactly the same bewildered expression as though he were lost and yet he seemed quite calm
7,null,null,his only movement was one hand that wandered up and down his waistcoat feeling the buttons one after the other .
1079 17
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,"  The life here is over
2,null,null,"   said Aunt Anne
3,null,null,"  Everything is over the house is dead
4,null,null,Of course you must go
5,anger,anger,If you feel anger with me now or afterwards remember that I have lost every hope or desire I ever had
6,null,null,I dont want your pity
7,null,null,I want no one 's pity
8,null,null,I wanted once your affection
9,null,null,but I wanted it on my own terms
10,null,null,That was wrong
11,null,null,I do not want your affection any longer
12,null,null,you were never the girl I thought you
13,null,null,you 're a strange girl
14,null,null,Maggie
15,null,null,and you will have
16,null,null,I am afraid
17,null,null,a very unhappy life .  "
1107 7
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,And that other life began to be dim and faint even Martin was a little hidden and mysterious
2,happiness,glad,Strangely she was glad of that
3,null,null,the only way that this could be carried through was by keeping the other out of it
4,null,null,Would the two worlds mingle
5,null,null,Would the faces and voices of those spirits be seen and heard again
6,null,null,Would they leave Maggie now or plan to steal her back
7,null,null,The whole future of her life depended on the answer to that
1109 3
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,surprise,She then would  "  lose her temper "   so much to her own surprise that she at once decided that some one else must be responsible
2,null,null,A few days after her return she decided that she  "  must not let these things go
3,null,null,"   so she told Maggie that she would attend the Committee of Old Women 's Comforts and be responsible for the Choir practice .
1118 11
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,despair,It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune
2,null,null,which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country
3,null,null,Moreover
4,null,null,he had once more lost the Princess Badoura 's talisman
5,null,null,which he feared he might never see again
6,null,null,There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done
7,null,null,and to live on in the cottage
8,null,null,As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself
9,null,null,he engaged a lad to help him
10,null,null,and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars
11,null,null,filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport .
1131 17
 (15, 14),
1,null,null,With that he supplied me with provisions
2,null,null,and bade me farewell
3,null,null,and I set out with my new companions
4,null,null,I soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts
5,null,null,but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks
6,null,null,I did not at all understand how we were to do it
7,null,null,The crowns of the cocoa palms were all alive with monkeys
8,null,null,big and little
9,null,null,which skipped from one to the other with surprising agility
10,null,null,seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance
11,null,null,and I was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures
12,null,null,which seemed to me quite harmless
13,null,null,But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily
14,null,null,for the monkeys
15,anger,annoyed,annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin
16,null,null,began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful gestures
17,null,null,so that after very little labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained .
1134 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,As will be imagined
2,surprise,surprise,these words took the Sultan by surprise
3,null,null,and he looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess
4,null,null,As I was unable to speak
5,null,null,I placed my hand on my head to show that it was true .
1137 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,"  When I saw you on the sea-shore I took a great fancy to you
2,null,null,and wished to try your good nature
3,null,null,so I presented myself in the disguise you saw
4,null,null,Now I have rewarded you by saving your life
5,anger,angry,But I am very angry with your brothers
6,null,null,and I shall not rest till I have taken their lives .  "
1154 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  Sire
2,null,null,"   replied the bird
3,null,null,before either the princes or the princess could speak
4,surprise,surprised,"  surely your Highness cannot be so surprised at beholding a cucumber stuffed with pearls
5,null,null,when you believed without any difficulty that the Sultana had presented you
6,null,null,instead of children
7,null,null,with a dog
8,null,null,a cat
9,null,null,and a log of wood .  "
1161 7
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,That was it
2,null,null,Sure
3,null,null,men lived on men
4,null,null,Look at the slaves
5,null,null,They were men
6,anger,excitement,That 's what all this excitement was about these days
7,null,null,Men killing other men negroes
1166 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,"  Why
2,null,null,Nancy Arabella
3,null,null,"   he said to Mrs Cowperwood on arriving one Sunday afternoon
4,surprise,astonishment,and throwing the household into joyous astonishment at his unexpected and unheralded appearance
5,null,null,"  you have n't grown an inch
6,null,null,I thought when you married old brother Hy here that you were going to fatten up like your brother
7,null,null,But look at you
8,null,null,I swear to Heaven you dont weigh five pounds
9,null,null,And he jounced her up and down by the waist
10,null,null,much to the perturbation of the children
11,null,null,who had never before seen their mother so familiarly handled .
1177 4
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,Cowperwood smiled his hearty
2,happiness,genial smile,genial smile
3,null,null,He was feeling very comfortable under this evidence of approval
4,null,null,He looked bright and cheery in his well-made clothes of English tweed .
1200 18
 (14, 13),
1,null,null,During all these days young Cowperwood was following these financial complications with interest
2,null,null,He was not disturbed by the cause of slavery
3,null,null,or the talk of secession
4,null,null,or the general progress or decline of the country
5,null,null,except in so far as it affected his immediate interests
6,null,null,He longed to become a stable financier
7,null,null,but
8,null,null,now that he saw the inside of the brokerage business
9,null,null,he was not so sure that he wanted to stay in it
10,null,null,Gambling in stocks
11,null,null,according to conditions produced by this panic
12,null,null,seemed very hazardous
13,null,null,A number of brokers failed
14,sadness,anguished faces,He saw them rush in to Tighe with anguished faces and ask that certain trades be canceled
15,null,null,Their very homes were in danger
16,null,null,they said
17,null,null,They would be wiped out
18,null,null,their wives and children put out on the street .
1212 22
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,In the midst of this early work he married Mrs
2,null,null,Semple
3,null,null,There was no vast to-do about it
4,null,null,as he did not want any and his bride-to-be was nervous
5,fear,fearsome,fearsome of public opinion
6,null,null,His family did not entirely approve
7,null,null,She was too old
8,null,null,his mother and father thought
9,null,null,and then Frank
10,null,null,with his prospects
11,null,null,could have done much better
12,null,null,His sister Anna fancied that Mrs
13,null,null,Semple was designing
14,null,null,which was
15,null,null,of course
16,null,null,not true
17,null,null,His brothers
18,null,null,Joseph and Edward
19,null,null,were interested
20,null,null,but not certain as to what they actually thought
21,null,null,since Mrs
22,null,null,Semple was good-looking and had some money .
1233 13
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood at this time was thirty-two years old
3,null,null,Cowperwood twenty-seven
4,null,null,The birth and care of two children had made some difference in her looks
5,null,null,She was no longer as softly pleasing
6,null,null,more angular
7,null,null,Her face was hollow cheeked
8,null,null,like so many of Rossetti 's and Burne-Jones 's women
9,null,null,Her health was really not as good as it had been the care of two children and a late undiagnosed tendency toward gastritis having reduced her
10,sadness,suffered from fits of depression,In short she was a little run down nervously and suffered from fits of depression
11,null,null,Cowperwood had noticed this
12,null,null,He tried to be gentle and considerate
13,null,null,but he was too much of a utilitarian and practical minded observer not to realize that he was likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later .
1237 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes
2,null,null,though he knew them to be trying to many
3,sadness,moved him greatly,Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly
4,null,null,but
5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him .
1245 9
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,"  Wait till you see them
2,happiness,pleased,I think you will be pleased
3,null,null,Mr
4,null,null,Cowperwood
5,null,null,I am taking especial pains with yours because it is smaller
6,null,null,It is really easier to treat your father 's
7,null,null,But yours  "   He went off into a description of the entrance hall
8,null,null,reception room and parlor
9,null,null,which he was arranging and decorating in such a way as to give an effect of size and dignity not really conformable to the actual space .
1273 6
 (5, 3),
1,null,null,"  Fine
2,null,null,let me tell you
3,null,null,I stepped on a lady 's dress over there
4,null,null,last dance
5,anger,angry,She was terribly angry
6,null,null,She gave me such a look .  "
1277 25
 (21, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident
3,null,null,in so many ways
4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then
18,null,null,O Heavens
19,null,null,the palaver
20,null,null,What beatings of tom-toms
21,anger,platitudes,What mouthings of pharisaical moralities platitudes
22,null,null,Run now
23,null,null,good people
24,null,null,for you may see clearly how evil is dealt with in high places
25,null,null,It made him smile .
1283 8
 (4, 2),
1,null,null,At the same time
2,null,null,in contemplating his wife in connection with all this
3,null,null,he had many qualms
4,disgust,emotional,some emotional
5,null,null,some financial
6,null,null,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death
7,null,null,he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see
8,null,null,combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton .
1293 10
 (4, 2),(4, 3),
1,null,null,for the time being there was lovemaking
2,null,null,the usual billing and cooing of lovers in a simple and much less than final fashion
3,null,null,and the lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching spring were idyllic
4,happiness,a sense of joy,Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such as he fancied
5,null,null,in the blush of this new desire
6,null,null,he had never experienced before
7,null,null,Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had first called on her in North Front Street
8,null,null,and he had fancied himself unspeakably happy at that time
9,null,null,but that was nearly ten years since
10,null,null,and he had forgotten .
1308 13
 (13, 12),
1,null,null,However
2,null,null,by the spring and summer of 1871
3,null,null,Cowperwood had actually
4,null,null,without being in any conceivable danger from any source
5,null,null,spread himself out very thin
6,null,null,Because of his great success he had grown more liberal easier in his financial ventures
7,null,null,By degrees
8,null,null,and largely because of his own confidence in himself
9,null,null,he had induced his father to enter upon his street car speculations
10,null,null,to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary
11,null,null,In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical
12,null,null,but as time had worn on and nothing but profit eventuated
13,happiness,more confident,he grew bolder and more confident .
1315 8
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,"  Sure that 's a nice little storm in a teapot
2,null,null,now
3,null,null,is n't it
4,null,null,Chicago begins to burn
5,fear,worry,and I have to worry here in Philadelphia
6,null,null,Well
7,null,null,well  "   Cowperwood was up now and moving to the door
8,null,null,"  And where are you going
1319 15
 (10, 9),
1,null,null,They were allied in no one particular financial proposition
2,null,null,any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were
3,null,null,And besides
4,null,null,in all probability Cowperwood was no fool
5,null,null,He was not equally guilty with Stener
6,null,null,the latter had loaned him money
7,null,null,The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues
8,null,null,but he decided not
