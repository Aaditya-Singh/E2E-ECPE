2,null,null,but my request was refused
3,null,null,The superior told me that I must deliberate and decide alone
4,null,null,and that when once my decision was taken
5,null,null,there could be no change
6,null,null,So I remained at the asylum
7,null,null,and dined at the superior 's table
8,null,null,and during the night I occupied the room of a sister who was absent
9,surprise,surprised,What surprised me most of all was the deference with which I was treated

7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret

6,null,null,I felt greatly alarmed about the prospects of the expedition
7,null,null,scarcely knowing what I should do
8,null,null,I resolved at last
9,null,null,if everything else failed
10,null,null,to make up a raft at the southern end of the N'yanza
11,null,null,and try to go up to the Nile in that way .
831 11

6,fear,terrible,thinking what a terrible thing it was I could not prevail on my men to view things as I did
7,null,null,Neither my experience with native chiefs
8,null,null,nor my money and guns
9,null,null,were of any use to me
10,null,null,simply because my men were such incomprehensible fools
11,null,null,though many of them who had travelled before ought to have known better .

2,null,null,it 's bad luck
3,null,null,"   she cried
4,sadness,distress fully,staring distress fully at the old man
5,null,null,He smiled
6,null,null,and would have certainly been very agreeable to her had not Aunt Anne

8,null,null,arrived and taken Maggie away .

 (2, 4),
1,null,null,Fainted right off there in the drawing-room

2,null,null,Maggie sat between her two aunts
3,surprise,surprise,She could not feel for the moment anything but a startled surprise at the ugliness of the building
4,null,null,She had entered at different times the Glebeshire chapels
5,null,null,but their primitive position and need had given them the spirit of honest sincerity .
914 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Amongst that black garbed assembly the blue dress shone out as though it would attract everything to itself
2,null,null,"  She 's very pretty
3,null,null,"   thought Maggie
4,null,null,who was more conscious of her shabby clothes than ever
5,surprise,surprise,But her chief feeling was of surprise that so brilliant a bird had been able to penetrate into the chapel at all
6,null,null,"  She must be a stranger just come out of curiosity .  "
927 5

1,null,null,"  I might not have come

1,null,null,Then when at last she had mounted the vehicle she would flood the conductor with a stream of little questions
2,null,null,darting her eyes angrily at all her neighbours as though they were gathered there together to murder her at the earliest opportunity
3,sadness,confused,She would be desperately confused when asked to pay for her ticket
4,null,null,would be unable to find her purse
5,null,null,and then when she discovered it would scatter its contents upon the ground
6,null,null,In such an agony would she be at the threatened passing of her destination that she would spring up at every pause of the omnibus
7,null,null,striking her nearest neighbour 's eye or nose with her umbrella
8,null,null,apologising nervously
9,null,null,and then
10,null,null,because she thought she had been too forward with a stranger
11,null,null,staring fiercely about her and daring any one to speak to her .

1,null,null,I could n't imagine what they were all about
2,null,null,it wasnt the ordinary London congregation

7,null,null,a kind of prophet all on his own

 (4, 2),
1,null,null,"  they 've been to some meeting
2,null,null,She stood looking at him with her fine steady gaze that had always made him afraid of her
3,null,null,and did so
4,surprise,surprise,to his own surprise
5,null,null,again now
6,null,null,He had thought that his clothes would have saved him from that
7,null,null,his fingers felt at his button hole .
947 9
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,"  Why
2,null,null,Mathew
3,null,null,You never told us

9,null,null,But at least you 've had Maggie to entertain you .  "
948 5

2,null,null,Her little escape into the streets
3,null,null,her posting of the letter
4,null,null,had been followed so immediately by Uncle Mathew 's visit
5,null,null,and now this invitation
949 4
 (1, 2),
1,fear,frightened,For a moment Maggie was frightened
2,null,null,She was here in a strange hotel in a strange room with a man whom she scarcely knew
3,null,null,Then she looked up into young Warlock 's face and was reassured
4,null,null,She could trust him .
980 4
 (1, 1),
1,fear,panic,In a panic at these thoughts
2,null,null,and feeling as though some one was trying to push her down into a coffin whilst she was still alive
3,null,null,she began hurriedly to speak
4,null,null,although she did not know whether her aunt were asleep or no .
988 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,he did not know whether he liked her it was interest rather that drew him
2,null,null,her strangeness
3,null,null,her strength and loneliness
4,happiness,touched,young and solitary like the moon above him and yet also some feeling softer than interest so that he was suddenly touched as he thought of her and spoke out aloud :   "  i 'll be good to her whatever happens
5,null,null,by God i 'll be good to her
6,null,null,"   so that a chauffeur near him turned and looked with hard scornful eyes
7,null,null,and a girl somewhere laughed .

1,null,null,Miss Pyncheon was the soul of good nature but she was much more than that
2,null,null,She was by far the most sensible

2,null,null,All the same I dont believe in this business
3,null,null,father all this Second Coming and the rest of it .
998 5
 (5, 4),
1,null,null,Two events occurred that filled her mind and made the week pass quickly
2,null,null,One was that she received an answer to her adventurous letter
3,null,null,the other was a remarkable conversation with Miss Caroline Smith
4,null,null,The answer to her letter was lying on her plate when she came down to breakfast
5,happiness,excited,and Aunt Elizabeth was watching it with an excited stare .

4,null,null,No
5,null,null,no one
6,null,null,She could have cried with pity at the thought of her own loneliness .
1016 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But Maggie had no eloquence in reply she could not make up fine sentences
2,sadness,embarrassed,it embarrassed her dreadfully to tell him even that she loved him
3,null,null,and when he was sentimental it was her habit to turn it off with a joke if she could
4,null,null,She wanted terribly to ask him sometimes what he had meant when he said that he didnt love her as he had loved other women .
1020 4
 (1, 1),

3,null,null,"   he said
4,sadness,despairing,At the word  "  darling "   the prophet cast another despairing look about the shop
5,null,null,as though he knew well the length of time that lovers could take over these things if they once put their hearts into it

1,null,null,As he breathed she breathed too
2,null,null,and it seemed to her that their bodies rose and fell as one body
3,null,null,Without looking directly at him

6,sadness,embarrass,embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her

6,null,null,Henry Waterman could scarcely understand why obvious success in this field did not interest him
7,null,null,He feared the effect of his departure on the business .

1,happiness,was a great improvement,The home atmosphere which they established when they returned from their honeymoon was a great improvement in taste over that which had characterized the earlier life of Mrs
2,null,null,Cowperwood as Mrs
3,null,null,Semple
4,null,null,They had decided to occupy her house
5,null,null,on North Front Street
6,null,null,for a while at least .
1222 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The children took up a great deal of her time
2,null,null,However
3,null,null,Cowperwood was not troubled about this
4,happiness,delightful,It struck him as delightful and exceedingly worth while that she should be so devoted
5,null,null,At the same time
6,null,null,her lethargic manner
7,null,null,vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference
8,null,null,which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security
9,null,null,attracted him also .
1241 21
 (21, 8),(21, 9),
1,null,null,He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes
2,null,null,though he knew them to be trying to many
3,null,null,Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly
4,null,null,but
5,null,null,alas
6,null,null,they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life
7,null,null,and could not be remedied by him
8,null,null,So he had gone his way day by day
9,null,null,watching the coming in and the departing of troops
10,null,null,seeing the bands of dirty
11,null,null,disheveled
12,null,null,gaunt
13,null,null,sickly men returning from the fields and hospitals
14,null,null,and all he could do was to feel sorry
15,null,null,This war was not for him
16,null,null,He had taken no part in it
17,null,null,and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in its conclusion not as a patriot
18,null,null,but as a financier
19,null,null,It was wasteful

1,null,null,"  Cowperwood
2,null,null,"   he said to him the first morning he ever broached this matter it was in Stener 's office
3,null,null,at the old city hall at Sixth and Chestnut
4,null,null,and Stener
5,null,null,in view of his oncoming prosperity
6,happiness,feeling very good indeed,was feeling very good indeed  "  is n't there some street railway property around town here that a man could buy in on and get control of if he had sufficient money
1250 25
 (25, 25),
1,null,null,Cowperwood knew that there were such properties
2,null,null,His very alert mind had long since sensed the general opportunities here
3,null,null,The omnibuses were slowly disappearing
4,null,null,The best routes were already preempted
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,there were other streets
7,null,null,and the city was growing
8,null,null,The incoming population would make great business in the future
9,null,null,One could afford to pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait and extend the lines into larger and better areas later
10,null,null,And already he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the  "  endless chain
11,null,null,"   or  "  agreeable formula
12,null,null,"   as it was later termed
13,null,null,of buying a certain property on a long-time payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient not only to pay your seller
14,null,null,but to reimburse you for your trouble
15,null,null,to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other things  allied properties
16,null,null,for instance
17,null,null,against which more bonds could be issued
18,null,null,and so on
19,null,null,ad infinitum
20,null,null,It became an old story later
21,null,null,but it was new at that time
22,null,null,and he kept the thought closely to himself
23,null,null,None the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this
24,null,null,since street railways were his hobby
25,happiness,convinced,and he was convinced that he would be a great master of them if he ever had an opportunity to control them .

6,null,null,thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple
7,null,null,and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles
8,null,null,The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first
9,null,null,and she chided her maid

11,null,null,She studied how to arrange her hair
12,null,null,and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted
13,null,null,She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy
14,null,null,She cut black court plaster with her nail shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places
15,null,null,Finally
16,null,null,she found one size and one place that suited her

18,null,null,looking at the combined effect of her hair

5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did

12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves

31,null,null,Let it wag as it would
32,null,null,The thing for him to do was to get rich and hold his own to build up a seeming of virtue and dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing
33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit
35,null,null,And he had these
36,null,null,"  I satisfy myself

3,null,null,And by odysseus ' prompting I Was marked for slaughter
4,null,null,to be sacrificed To the sea powers
5,null,null,beside the moaning waves
6,null,null,To win them safe return .
1646 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Into Oenone 's presence thus he came
2,surprise,Amazed,Amazed her thronging handmaids looked on him As at the Nymph 's feet that pale suppliant fell Faint with the anguish of his wound
3,null,null,whose pangs Stabbed him through brain and heart .
1652 5
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,mourned,Troy 's daughters mourned within her walls
2,null,null,might none Go forth to paris ' tomb
3,null,null,for far away From high built Troy it lay
4,null,null,But the young men Without the city toiled unceasingly In fight wherein from slaughter rest was none
5,null,null,Though dead was Paris .
1653 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Far from his brawny hand Euryalus hurled A massy stone
2,null,null,and shook the ranks of Troy
3,anger,anger,As when in anger against long screaming cranes A watcher of the field leaps from the ground
4,null,null,In swift hand whirling round his head the sling
5,null,null,And speeds the stone against them
6,null,null,scattering Before its hum their ranks far down the wind Outspread .
1663 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,We took coach for the City to Guildhall
2,null,null,where the Hall was full of people expecting Monk and Lord Mayor to come thither
3,happiness,joyfull,and all very joyful Met Monk coming out of the chamber where he had been with the Mayor and Aldermen
4,null,null,but such a shout I never heard in all my life .
1693 9
 (6, 7),
1,null,null,When it comes the next month to sit again
2,null,null,would bring trouble with it
3,null,null,and enquire how the King had disposed of offices and money
4,null,null,before they will raise more

6,fear,fear,I fear
7,null,null,will bring all things to ruin again
8,null,null,Dined with Captain Lambert and his father-in-law
9,null,null,and had much talk of Portugal .
1694 4
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,pains,The greatest pains were afterwards taken to preserve the fortress
2,null,null,and a fine Mole was constructed
3,null,null,at a vast expense
4,null,null,to improve the harbour .
1699 5
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,My Lord Peterborough is come unexpected from Tangier
2,null,null,to give the King an account of the place
3,null,null,which
4,fear,fear,we fear
5,null,null,is in none of the best condition We had also certain news to-day that the Spaniard is before Lisbone with thirteen sayle .
1703 3
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,No more Cared they for deeds of men
2,sadness,cried,but cried to the Gods For swift feet
3,null,null,in whose feet alone was hope To escape eurymachus ' and aeneas ' spears Which lightened ever all along their rear .
1704 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Scared were the Argives
2,fear,startled,like a startled team Of oxen ' neath the yoke band straining hard
3,null,null,What time the sharp fanged gadfly stings their flanks Athirst for blood .
1723 9
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,For the first quarter of an hour
2,null,null,in spite of the September chill
3,null,null,the sweat poured off me in streams
4,null,null,And the course well
5,null,null,if was not steering
6,null,null,it was sculling
7,null,null,the old bumboat was wobbling all around like a drunken tailor with two left legs
8,sadness,apprehension,I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass
9,null,null,I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way .
1724 6
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,Such brutality I never witnessed before
2,null,null,On board of English ships ( except men-of-war ) there is practically no discipline
3,disgust,bad,which is bad
4,null,null,but this sort of thing was maddening
5,null,null,knew how desperately ill all those poor wretches were
6,null,null,how helpless and awkward they would be if quite hale and hearty .
1726 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,It was a splendid picture
2,happiness,glad,but for the time I felt glad I was not on board of her
3,null,null,a very few minutes she was out of our ken
4,null,null,followed by the admiration of all .
1727 10
 (5, 6),(5, 7),(5, 8),
1,null,null,We were all gathered about the folk ' sle scuttle one evening
2,null,null,a few days after the gale referred to in the previous chapter
3,null,null,and the question of whale fishing came up for discussion
4,null,null,Until that time
5,surprise,strange,strange as it may seem
6,null,null,no word of this
7,null,null,the central idea of all our minds
8,null,null,had been mooted
9,null,null,ery man seemed to shun the subject
10,null,null,although we were in daily expectation of being called upon to take an active part in whale fighting .
1733 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,There were men in that forecastle as good citizens and as brave fellows as you would wish to meet men who in their own sphere would have commanded and obtained respect
2,sadness,painful,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
3,null,null,Half starved and hopeless
4,null,null,their spirit had been so broken
5,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
6,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
7,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves .
1764 9
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,For the boat was crumbled into innumerable fragments
2,null,null,and the three hundred fathoms of line
3,null,null,in a perfect maze of entanglement
4,null,null,appeared to be wrapped about the writhing trunk of the whale
5,happiness,Happily,Happily
6,null,null,there were two boats disengaged
7,null,null,so that they were able very promptly to rescue the sufferers from their perilous position in the boiling vortex of foam by which they were surrounded
8,null,null,Meanwhile
9,null,null,the remaining boat had an easy task .
1772 8
 (7, 7),
1,null,null,It will not
2,null,null,of course
3,null,null,have escaped the reader 's notice that I have not hitherto attempted to give any details concerning the structure of the whale just dealt with
4,null,null,The omission is intentional
5,null,null,During this
6,null,null,our first attempt at real whaling
7,fear,disturbed,my mind was far too disturbed by the novelty and danger of the position in which I found myself for the first time
8,null,null,for me to pay any intelligent attention to the party of the second part .
1804 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Therefore
2,sadness,rough,we had all a rough time of it while his angry fit lasted
3,null,null,which was a whole week
4,null,null,or until all was shipshape again
5,null,null,Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo
6,null,null,never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business .
1806 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,The truth of Mr
2,null,null,Count 's forecast was verified to the hilt
3,null,null,for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about
4,null,null,the body that he was unable to move
5,null,null,while one of the hands
6,null,null,a Portuguese
7,null,null,was injured internally
8,null,null,and seemed very bad indeed
9,sadness,sorry,Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones
10,null,null,we should have scoffed at the notion
11,null,null,and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart .
1824 10
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters
2,null,null,but at last
3,happiness,joy,to our great joy
4,null,null,they broke water from sounding right among us
5,null,null,It was a considerable surprise
6,null,null,but we were all ready
7,null,null,and before they had spouted twice
8,null,null,three boats were fast
9,null,null,only myself keeping out
10,null,null,in accordance with my instructions .
1827 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Thenceforward for another hour
2,null,null,in spite of all our efforts
3,null,null,we could not get within striking distance
4,null,null,mainly because of the close attention of the cow
5,null,null,which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother
6,disgust,impatient,I was getting so impatient of this hindrance
7,null,null,that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow
8,null,null,though I felt convinced that
9,null,null,if I did
10,null,null,I should spoil a good job .
1831 6
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,but then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related .
1850 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,And
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable
4,null,null,so free from anything to regret
5,happiness,smile,Perhaps this simple statement will raise a cynical smile upon the lips of those who know Tahati
6,null,null,the New Hebrides
7,null,null,and kindred spots with all their savage
8,null,null,bestial orgies of alternate unbridled lust and unnamable cruelty .
1867 5
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Satisfied that our days in the southern hemisphere were numbered
2,null,null,and all anxiety to point her head for home
3,happiness,pleasing,this news was most pleasing
4,null,null,putting all of us in the best of humours
5,null,null,and provoking quite an entertainment of song and dance until nearly four bells .
1880 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,not only on his own account but on hers and his father 's
2,null,null,In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose
3,fear,fearing,fearing to wound his pride
4,null,null,she had put it solely on the ground of his settling down to some work .
1888 11
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,They found that Ragnar was dead
2,null,null,and that Kraka had already married one Brak
3,null,null,Then they remembered the father 's treasure
4,null,null,dug up the money
5,null,null,and bore it off
6,null,null,But Erik 's fame had gone before him
7,null,null,and Gotar had learnt all his good fortune
8,null,null,Now when Gotar learnt that he had come himself
9,null,null,he feared that his immense self-confidence would lead him to plan the worst against the Norwegians
10,null,null,and was anxious to take his wife from him and marry him to his own daughter in her place :  for his queen had just died
11,fear,anxious,and he was anxious to marry the sister of Frode more than anyone .
1893 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Thus SIWARD
2,null,null,by the sovereign vote of the whole Danish assembly
3,null,null,received the empire of his father
4,happiness,satisfied,But after the defeats he had inflicted everywhere he was satisfied with the honour he received at home
5,null,null,and liked better to be famous with the gown than with the sword .
1920 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,"  No
2,anger,made him angry,what I told about the way they treated you and me made him angry
3,null,null,and he drove to the Astor House
4,null,null,I have a room there
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,and am to act as his private secretary .  "
1927 7
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,As I drew nearer and nearer to the light
2,null,null,the chasm became wider
3,null,null,and at last I saw
4,surprise,amaze,to my unspeakable amaze
5,null,null,a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss and illumined as far as the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas lamps placed at regular intervals
6,null,null,as in the thoroughfare of a great city
7,null,null,and I heard confusedly at a distance a hum as of human voices .
1940 16
 (4, 6),
1,null,null,The children paused for a moment and glanced at each other
2,null,null,wondering which one of them was going to commit to an answer
3,null,null,' well
4,sadness,miss,I miss it terribly
5,null,null,' said Gretel eventually
6,null,null,' i would n't mind having some friends again
7,null,null,Bruno smiled
8,null,null,thinking about his secret
9,null,null,' friends
10,null,null,' said Father
11,null,null,nodding his head
12,null,null,' yes
13,null,null,i 've often thought of that
14,null,null,It must have been lonely for you at times
15,null,null,' very lonely
16,null,null,' said Gretel in a determined voice .
1942 14
 (13, 14),
1,null,null,Bruno thought about it
2,null,null,' well
3,null,null,I would n't like it if you were n't there
4,null,null,' he said
5,null,null,because that was the truth
6,null,null,' so you 'd prefer to stay here with me
7,null,null,i 'd prefer all four of us to stay together
8,null,null,' he said
9,null,null,reluctantly including Gretel in that
10,null,null,' whether that was in Berlin or out with
11,null,null,' oh
12,null,null,Bruno
13,anger,exasperated,' said Gretel in an exasperated voice
14,null,null,and he didnt know whether that was because he might be spoiling the plans for their return or because ( according to her ) he continued to mispronounce the name of their home .
1950 10
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,One evening in April in the year 1308
2,null,null,Tirechair came home in a remarkably bad temper
3,null,null,For three days past everything had been in good order on the King 's highway
4,null,null,Now
5,null,null,as an officer of the peace
6,anger,annoyed,nothing annoyed him so much as to feel himself useless
7,null,null,He flung down his halbert in a rage
8,null,null,muttered inarticulate words as he pulled off his doublet
9,null,null,half red and half blue
10,null,null,and slipped on a shabby camlet jerkin .
1958 10
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,null,null,Shmuel shook his head
2,null,null,' that 's all right
3,null,null,' he said
4,null,null,' there 's a hut where they keep them
5,null,null,I can get some in my size and bring them with me
6,null,null,Then you can change and we can look for Papa
7,happiness,Wonderful,' wonderful
8,null,null,' said Bruno
9,null,null,caught up in the enthusiasm of the moment
10,null,null,' then it 's a plan . '
1960 15
 (15, 3),
1,null,null,' hello
2,null,null,Bruno
3,null,null,' he said when he saw his friend approaching
4,null,null,' hello
5,null,null,Shmuel
6,null,null,' said Bruno
7,null,null,' i wasnt sure if we 'd ever see each other again with the rain and everything
8,null,null,I mean
9,null,null,' said Shmuel
10,null,null,' i thought you might be kept indoors
11,null,null,' it was touch and go for a while
12,null,null,' said Bruno
13,null,null,' what with the weather being so bad
14,null,null,Shmuel nodded and held out his hands to Bruno
15,happiness,opened his mouth in delight,who opened his mouth in delight .
1968 8
 (4, 1),
1,null,null,But they didnt find anything at all that might give them a clue to Shmuel 's papa 's disappearance
2,null,null,and it started to get darker
3,null,null,Bruno looked up at the sky and it looked like it might rain again
4,sadness,sorry,' im sorry
5,null,null,Shmuel
6,null,null,' he said eventually
7,null,null,' im sorry we didnt find any evidence
8,null,null,Shmuel nodded his head sadly .
1981 3
 (1, 1),(1, 3),
1,fear,agitated,Elennor was very agitated about it because it involved a life even though
2,null,null,as she acknowledged
3,null,null,it was the life of a murderer .
1987 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The key to successfully designing a validation control is to give users generous feedback
2,anger,resentful,An entry control that merely refuses to accept input is just plain rude and will guarantee an angry and resentful user .

1,null,null,Mrs
2,happiness,burst into hysterical laughter,Wang burst into hysterical laughter and said
3,null,null,"  Your courage is no bigger than a mustard seed
4,null,null,"   and she indicated the size with her thumb pressed against the tip of her forefinger .
2004 3
 (1, 2),(1, 3),
1,sadness,repented,She deemed in her crime most to be repented of
2,null,null,that she had ever endured and reciprocated the lukewarm grasp of his hand
3,null,null,and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own .

2056 23
 (10, 9),(10, 10),
1,null,null,Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute
2,null,null,trying to make out which were the two sides of it
3,null,null,and as it was perfectly round
4,null,null,she found this a very difficult question  .  However
5,null,null,at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go
6,null,null,and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
7,null,null,nd now which is which
8,null,null,' she said to herself
9,null,null,and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect :  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin :  it had struck her foot
10,fear,a good deal frightened,She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change
11,null,null,but she felt that there was no time to be lost
12,null,null,as she was shrinking rapidly
13,null,null,so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot
14,null,null,that there was hardly room to open her mouth
15,null,null,but she did it at last
16,null,null,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come
17,null,null,my head 's free at last
18,null,null,' said Alice in a tone of delight
19,null,null,which changed into alarm in another moment
20,null,null,when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found :  all she could see
21,null,null,when she looked down
22,null,null,was an immense length of neck
23,null,null,which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
2069 26
 (19, 17),
1,null,null,theyre done with blacking
2,null,null,I believe
3,null,null,Boots and shoes under the sea
4,null,null,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice
5,null,null,are done with a whiting . Now you know
6,null,null,And what are they made of
7,null,null,' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity Soles and eels
8,null,null,of course
9,null,null,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently :   any shrimp could have told you that
10,null,null,If i 'd been the whiting
11,null,null,' said Alice
12,null,null,whose thoughts were still running on the song
13,null,null,i 'd have said to the porpoise
14,null,null,"  Keep back
15,null,null,please :  we dont want YOU with us
16,null,null,"  '  They were obliged to have him with them
17,null,null,' the Mock Turtle said :   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
18,null,null,would n't it really
19,surprise,in a tone of great surprise,' said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not
20,null,null,' said the Mock Turtle :   why
21,null,null,if a fish came to ME
22,null,null,and told me he was going a journey
23,null,null,I should say  "  With what porpoise
24,null,null,"  '  dont you mean  "  purpose "
25,null,null,' said Alice I mean what I say
26,null,null,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone
2071 28
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,Off with her head
2,null,null,' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved Who cares for you
3,null,null,' said Alice
4,null,null,( she had grown to her full size by this time
5,null,null,you 're nothing but a pack of cards
6,null,null,' At this the whole pack rose up into the air
7,null,null,and came flying down upon her :  she gave a little scream
8,fear,half of fright and half of anger,half of fright and half of anger
9,null,null,and tried to beat them off
10,null,null,and found herself lying on the bank
11,null,null,with her head in the lap of her sister
12,null,null,who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up
13,null,null,Alice dear
14,null,null,' said her sister
15,null,null,Why
16,null,null,what a long sleep you 've had
17,null,null,'  Oh
18,null,null,i 've had such a curious dream
19,null,null,' said Alice
20,null,null,and she told her sister
21,null,null,as well as she could remember them
22,null,null,all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
23,null,null,and when she had finished
24,null,null,her sister kissed her
25,null,null,and said
26,null,null,It WAS a curious dream

4,null,null,' but then
5,null,null,as he looked at Sir James 's stately head
6,null,null,he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence
7,null,null,and so kind to himself
8,null,null,and
9,null,null,ashamed of the moment 's petulance
10,null,null,dismounted
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,as John said
13,null,null,' this is the way to our noon meat
14,null,null,' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade
15,null,null,sheltered from the wind
16,null,null,where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread
17,null,null,dried fish
18,null,null,and eggs was laid out on the grass
19,null,null,in a bright warm sunshine
20,null,null,and Hal
21,null,null,declaring himself to have a hunter 's appetite
22,null,null,and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland
23,null,null,and was as lean as a greyhound
24,null,null,seated himself on the grass
25,surprise,surprise,and to Malcolm 's extreme surprise
26,null,null,not to say disgust
