 (15, 14),
1,null,null,For two months I hunted thus
2,null,null,and no day passed without my securing
3,null,null,an elephant
4,null,null,Of course I did not always station myself in the same tree
5,null,null,but sometimes in one place
6,null,null,sometimes in another
7,null,null,One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised to see that
8,null,null,instead of passing the tree I was in
9,null,null,as they usually did
10,null,null,they paused
11,null,null,and completely surrounded it
12,null,null,trumpeting horribly
13,null,null,and shaking the very ground with their heavy tread
14,null,null,and when I saw that their eyes were fixed upon me
15,fear,was terrified,I was terrified
16,null,null,and my arrows dropped from my trembling hand
17,null,null,I had indeed good reason for my terror when
18,null,null,an instant later
19,null,null,the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree
20,null,null,and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots
21,null,null,bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches
22,null,null,I thought now that my last hour was surely come
23,null,null,but the huge creature
24,null,null,picking me up gently enough
25,null,null,set me upon its back
26,null,null,where I clung more dead than alive
27,null,null,and followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest
28,null,null,It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant
29,null,null,and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd
30,null,null,which turned and trampled off in another direction
31,null,null,and were soon hidden in the dense underwood
32,null,null,Then
33,null,null,recovering myself
34,null,null,I looked about me
35,null,null,and found that I was standing upon the side of a great hill
36,null,null,strewn as far as I could see on either hand with bones and tusks of elephants
37,null,null,"  This then must be the elephants ' burying place
38,null,null,"   I said to myself
39,null,null,"  and they must have brought me here that I might cease to persecute them
40,null,null,seeing that I want nothing but their tusks
41,null,null,and here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime .  "

6,null,null,but they were quieted when they saw I held it with great care
7,surprise,surprise,and great was their surprise when I made signs that I too wished to write something .

6,null,null,I have gained the battle
7,null,null,but it has cost me dear
8,null,null,The fire has penetrated to my heart
9,null,null,and I have only a few moments to live
10,null,null,This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest
11,null,null,It was the last struggle of the genius
12,null,null,and up to that time I was quite safe
13,null,null,But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire
14,null,null,and in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I knew more than he did
15,null,null,He is dead and in ashes

5,null,null,than the worthy arrived to call us on the same instant
6,fear,anxious,as the king was most anxious to see us
7,null,null,The love of good beer of course made our men all too tired to march again

 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,I then ( 16th ) very much wished to go and see the escape of the Mwerango river
2,disgust,sceptical,as I still felt a little sceptical as to its origin
3,null,null,whether or not it came off those smaller lakes I had seen on the road the day before I crossed the river
4,null,null,but no one would listen to my project
5,null,null,They all said I must have the king 's sanction first
6,null,null,else people
7,null,null,from not knowing my object
8,null,null,would accuse me of practising witchcraft
9,null,null,and would tell their king so
10,null,null,They still all maintained that the river did come out of the lake
11,null,null,and said
12,null,null,if I liked to ask the king 's leave to visit the spot
13,null,null,then they would go and show it me .

1,null,null,The pages dreaded their master 's wrath
2,null,null,departed for a while

4,null,null,but he hoped I would come if only for a minute
5,null,null,bringing my medicines with me
6,null,null,for he himself felt pain
7,null,null,That this second message was a forged one I had no doubt
8,null,null,for the boys had not been long enough gone
9,null,null,still
10,null,null,I packed up my medicines and went
11,null,null,leaving the onus
12,null,null,should any accident happen
13,null,null,upon the mischievous story bearers .
848 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I then sent Bombay to see the queen

7,anger,sorrow,but the sorrow and anger would be only for a little while
8,null,null,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people

4,fear,a panic,upon them she was besieged at once by so horrid a panic that she lost all control and self possession
5,null,null,She therefore very quickly put those things from her and thenceforth lived in the world as in a castle surrounded by a dark moat filled with horrible and slimy creatures who would raise a head at her did she so much as glance their way .

1,surprise,surprised,He went away thinking how surprised Drexel & Co
2,null,null,and Cooke & Co
3,null,null,would be to see him appearing in the field as a competitor
4,null,null,In his home
5,null,null,in a little room on the second floor next his bedroom
6,null,null,which he had fixed up as an office with a desk
7,null,null,a safe
8,null,null,and a leather chair
9,null,null,he consulted his resources .
1235 25
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,Sympathy and affection were great things
2,null,null,but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss
3,null,null,So often now he saw young girls who were quite in his mood
4,happiness,joyous,and who were exceedingly robust and joyous
5,null,null,It was fine
6,null,null,advisable
7,null,null,practical
8,null,null,to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon
9,null,null,but if you had a sickly wife  And anyhow
10,null,null,was a man entitled to only one wife
11,null,null,Must he never look at another woman
12,null,null,Supposing he found some one
13,null,null,He pondered those things between hours of labor
14,null,null,and concluded that it did not make so much difference
15,null,null,If a man could
16,null,null,and not be exposed
17,null,null,it was all right
18,null,null,He had to be careful
19,null,null,though
20,null,null,Tonight
21,null,null,as he sat on the side of his wife 's bed
22,null,null,he was thinking somewhat of this
23,null,null,for he had seen Aileen Butler again
24,null,null,playing and singing at her piano as he passed the parlor door
25,null,null,She was like a bright bird radiating health and enthusiasm a reminder of youth in general .
1249 25
 (23, 23),
1,null,null,Cowperwood knew that there were such properties
2,null,null,His very alert mind had long since sensed the general opportunities here
3,null,null,The omnibuses were slowly disappearing
4,null,null,The best routes were already preempted
5,null,null,Still
6,null,null,there were other streets
7,null,null,and the city was growing
8,null,null,The incoming population would make great business in the future
9,null,null,One could afford to pay almost any price for the short lines already built if one could wait and extend the lines into larger and better areas later
10,null,null,And already he had conceived in his own mind the theory of the  "  endless chain
11,null,null,"   or  "  agreeable formula
12,null,null,"   as it was later termed
13,null,null,of buying a certain property on a long-time payment and issuing stocks or bonds sufficient not only to pay your seller
14,null,null,but to reimburse you for your trouble
15,null,null,to say nothing of giving you a margin wherewith to invest in other things  allied properties
16,null,null,for instance
17,null,null,against which more bonds could be issued
18,null,null,and so on
19,null,null,ad infinitum
20,null,null,It became an old story later
21,null,null,but it was new at that time
22,null,null,and he kept the thought closely to himself
23,happiness,glad,None the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this
24,null,null,since street railways were his hobby
25,null,null,and he was convinced that he would be a great master of them if he ever had an opportunity to control them .
1255 12
 (8, 6),(8, 7),
1,null,null,It was curious
2,null,null,though
3,null,null,that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all their attention and fixed their minds on her so-called idiosyncrasies
4,null,null,All they said was in its peculiar way true
5,null,null,but in addition the girl was really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force
6,null,null,She was running deep with ambition
7,null,null,and she was all the more conspicuous
8,anger,irritating,and in a way irritating to some
9,null,null,because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects
10,null,null,against which she was inwardly fighting
11,null,null,She resented the fact that people could justly consider her parents ineligible
12,null,null,and for that reason her also .
1264 14
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsoned silver sequins
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,lo
4,null,null,it touched her
5,null,null,She liked its coquettish drapery of tulle and silver about the hips
6,null,null,The  "  overskirt
7,null,null,"   which was at that time just coming into fashion
8,null,null,though avoided by the more conservative
9,null,null,had been adopted by Aileen with enthusiasm
10,happiness,thrilled,She thrilled a little at the rustle of this black dress
11,null,null,and thrust her chin and nose forward to make it set right
12,null,null,Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little more
13,null,null,she gathered the train over her arm by its train band and looked again
14,null,null,Something was wanting .
1266 9
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,She lifted shy eyes to him now
2,null,null,for
3,null,null,in spite of her gay
4,fear,afraid,aggressive force she was afraid of him
5,null,null,His personality was obviously so dominating
6,null,null,Now that he was so close to her
7,null,null,dancing
8,null,null,she conceived of him as something quite wonderful
9,null,null,and yet she experienced a nervous reaction a momentary desire to run away .
1280 38
 (27, 6),
1,null,null,Again
2,null,null,it was so very evident
3,null,null,in so many ways
4,null,null,that force was the answer great mental and physical force
5,null,null,Why
6,null,null,these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life
7,null,null,and did
8,null,null,He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction
9,null,null,Worse the little guardians of so-called law and morality
10,null,null,the newspapers
11,null,null,the preachers
12,null,null,the police
13,null,null,and the public moralists generally
14,null,null,so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places
15,null,null,were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones
16,null,null,They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves
17,null,null,Then
18,null,null,O Heavens
19,null,null,the palaver
20,null,null,What beatings of tom-toms
21,null,null,What mouthings of pharisaical moralities platitudes
22,null,null,Run now
23,null,null,good people
24,null,null,for you may see clearly how evil is dealt with in high places
25,null,null,It made him smile
26,null,null,Such hypocrisy
27,anger,cant,Such cant
28,null,null,Still
29,null,null,so the world was organized
30,null,null,and it was not for him to set it right
31,null,null,Let it wag as it would
32,null,null,The thing for him to do was to get rich and hold his own to build up a seeming of virtue and dignity which would pass muster for the genuine thing
33,null,null,Force would do that
34,null,null,Quickness of wit
35,null,null,And he had these
36,null,null,"  I satisfy myself
37,null,null,"   was his motto
38,null,null,and it might well have been emblazoned upon any coat of arms which he could have contrived to set forth his claim to intellectual and social nobility .

16,null,null,why should there be concealment between them
17,null,null,or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to
18,null,null,Why do one thing and think another
19,null,null,To be sure
20,null,null,she was devoted to him in her quiet way
21,null,null,not passionately ( as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that )
22,null,null,but intellectually
23,null,null,Duty
24,null,null,as she understood it

6,null,null,Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers
7,null,null,His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch

1,null,null,Beside the ships he sat Ministering to the hurts of men with spears Stricken In wrath for his brother 's sake he rose
2,null,null,He clad him in his armour
3,fear,Dread battle prowess swelled,in his breast Dread battle prowess swelled for conflict grim He panted .
1581 6
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,grief,Then grief thrilled Pammon :  hard necessity Made him both chariot lord and charioteer
2,null,null,Now to his doom and death day had he bowed
3,null,null,Had not a Trojan through that gory strife Leapt
4,null,null,grasped the reins
5,null,null,and saved the prince
6,null,null,when now His strength failed ' neath the murderous hands of foes .
1584 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Yet the Greeks Slighted him not
2,null,null,but gave him all death dues
3,sadness,mourned,And mourned above his grave with no less grief Than for Machaon
4,null,null,whom they honoured aye
5,null,null,For his deep wisdom
6,null,null,as the immortal Gods .
1593 4
 (1, 4),(4, 4),
1,happiness,joy,And great shall be thy joy in bearing them
2,null,null,for these be like no mortal 's battle gear
3,null,null,But splendid as the very War-god 's arms
4,happiness,marvellous,Over their marvellous blazonry hath gold Been lavished .
1606 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,For death Rode upon all he cast
2,anger,wrath,and bare his wrath Straight rushing down upon the heads of foes
3,null,null,Now in their hearts those wildered Trojans said That once more they beheld achilles ' self Gigantic in his armour .
1607 6
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,His breath Kindles it to a flame
2,null,null,till round the boat Glareth its splendour
3,happiness,eager,and from the black sea Dart up the fish all eager to behold The radiance   for the last time
4,null,null,for the barbs Of his three pointed spear
5,null,null,as up they leap
6,null,null,Slay them .
1615 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Onward they whirled him
2,null,null,those immortal steeds
3,null,null,The which
4,happiness,longed,when now he longed to chase the foe Back from the ships
5,null,null,Automedon
6,null,null,who wont To rein them for his father
7,null,null,brought to him .
1630 7
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Then
2,happiness,eager,eager for the trojans ' help
3,null,null,swooped down Out of Olympus
4,null,null,cloaked about with clouds
5,null,null,The son of Leto
6,null,null,Mighty rushing winds Bare him in golden armour clad
7,null,null,and gleamed With lightning splendour of his descent the long Highways of air .
1631 8
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,overawed by the brother of his sire
3,fear,fearing,And fearing for Troy 's fate and for her folk
4,null,null,To heaven went back Apollo
5,null,null,to the sea Poseidon
6,null,null,But the sons of men fought on
7,null,null,And slew
8,null,null,and Strife incarnate gloating watched .
1637 6
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,This horse by calchas ' counsel fashioned they For wise Athena
2,null,null,to propitiate Her stern wrath for that guardian image stol'n From Troy
3,null,null,And by odysseus ' prompting I Was marked for slaughter
4,null,null,to be sacrificed To the sea powers
5,sadness,moaning,beside the moaning waves
6,null,null,To win them safe return .
1647 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Then in exceeding feebleness he spake :   "  O reverenced wife
2,anger,hate,turn not from me in hate For that I left thee widowed long ago
3,null,null,Not of my will I did it :  the strong Fates Dragged me to Helen   oh that I had died Ere I embraced her   in thine arms had died
1650 6
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,But Paris
2,null,null,while they talked
3,null,null,gave up the ghost On Ida :  never Helen saw him more
4,sadness,Loud wailed,Loud wailed the Nymphs around him
5,null,null,for they still Remembered how their nursling wont to lisp His childish prattle
6,null,null,compassed with their smiles .
1662 4
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I heard the news of a letter from Monk
2,null,null,who was now gone into the City again
3,null,null,and did resolve to stand for the sudden filling up of the House
4,surprise,very strange,and it was very strange how the countenance of men in the Hall was all changed with joy in half an hour 's time .
1679 3
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabin
2,happiness,thanks,I took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that he had given me of his Majesty 's money
3,null,null,and the Duke 's .
1683 6
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,An Oxford man
2,null,null,who spoke very much against the height of the now old clergy
3,null,null,for putting out many of the religious fellows of Colleges
4,anger,inveighing,and inveighing against them for their being drunk
5,null,null,It being post night
6,null,null,I wrote to my Lord to give him notice that all things are well .
1728 8
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,So we toiled watch and watch
2,null,null,six hours on and six off
3,null,null,the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty
4,null,null,and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great
5,null,null,there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil
6,null,null,Some of these were of enormous size
7,null,null,containing 350 gallons when full
8,fear,terrible,and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk .
1747 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,The ship kept near
2,null,null,and Mr
3,null,null,Count
4,null,null,seeing how matters were going
5,null,null,had hastily patched his boat
6,null,null,returning at once with another tub of line
7,null,null,He was but just in time to bend on
8,happiness,delight,when to our great delight we saw the end slip from our rival 's boat
9,null,null,This in no wise terminated his lien on the whale
10,null,null,supposing he could prove that he struck first
11,null,null,but it got him out of the way for the time .
1761 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
2,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
3,null,null,To my mind
4,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
5,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1787 12
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good
2,sadness,terrible,although subject to electric storms of the most terrible aspect
3,null,null,but perfectly harmless
4,null,null,On the second evening after rounding Cape St
5,null,null,Mary
6,null,null,we were proceeding
7,null,null,as usual
8,null,null,under very scanty sail
9,null,null,rather enjoying the mild
10,null,null,balmy air
11,null,null,scent laden
12,null,null,from Madagascar .
1792 10
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Up till now we had not succeeded in getting home a single lance
2,null,null,the foe was becoming warier
3,null,null,while the strain was certainly telling upon our nerves
4,null,null,So Mr
5,null,null,Count got out his bomb gun
6,null,null,shouting at the same time to Mr
7,null,null,Cruce to do the same
8,sadness,hated,They both hated these weapons
9,null,null,nor ever used them if they could help it
10,null,null,but what was to be done
1793 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,We got the whale cut in as usual without any incident worth mentioning
2,surprise,curiosity,except that the peculiar shape of the jaw made it an object of great curiosity to all of us who were new to the whale fishing
3,null,null,Such malformations are not very rare
4,null,null,They are generally thought to occur when the animal is young
5,null,null,and its bones soft
1799 10
 (5, 6),
1,null,null,It is
2,null,null,perhaps
3,null,null,hardly necessary to say that we promptly hauled our wind
4,null,null,and placed a good distance between us and that awful load of death as soon as possible
5,sadness,Poor,Poor wretches
6,null,null,What terrible calamity had befallen them
7,null,null,we could not guess
8,null,null,whatever it was
9,null,null,it had been complete
10,null,null,nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done .
1818 6
 (3, 4),
1,null,null,wasnt Mr
2,null,null,Count mad
3,anger,rage,I really thought he would split with rage
4,null,null,for it was impossible for us to go on with that hole in our bilge
5,null,null,The second mate came alongside and took our line as the whale was just commencing to sound
6,null,null,thus setting us free .
1821 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,When I recovered
2,null,null,I was snug in my bunk aboard
3,null,null,but aching in every joint
4,null,null,and as sore as if I had been pounded with a club until I was bruised all over
5,null,null,During the day Mr
6,happiness,kind,Count was kind enough to pay me a visit
7,null,null,With his usual luck
8,null,null,he had escaped without the slightest injury
1835 4
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,I put my hand out to help myself to a sitting posture
2,null,null,and touched blubber
3,fear,startled,That startled me so that I sprung up as if shot
4,null,null,Then I took in the situation at a glance .
1841 6
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animal ism as we witnessed at Honolulu
2,happiness,pleased,What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship
3,null,null,All the worship
4,null,null,all the management of affairs
5,null,null,was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves
6,null,null,and excellently well did they manage everything .
1856 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Rushing out of their house
2,null,null,they saw the heavens bespread with an awful pall of smoke
3,null,null,the underside of which was glowing with the reflected fires of some vast furnace
4,fear,terror,Their terror was increased by a smart shower of falling ashes and the reverberations of subterranean thunders
5,null,null,At first they thought of flight in their boat
6,null,null,not reckoning the wide stretch of sea which rolled between them and the nearest land
7,null,null,but the height and frequency of the breakers then prevailing made that impossible .
1857 8
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,Though they had but been dwellers on the threshold of the mountain
2,null,null,as it were
3,null,null,and any extension of their territory impossible by reason of the insurmountable barrier around them
4,happiness,untroubled,they had led an untroubled life
5,null,null,all unknowing of the fearful forces beneath their feet
6,null,null,But now they found the foundations of the rocks beneath breaking up
7,null,null,that withering
8,null,null,incessant shower of ashes and scoriae destroyed all their crops
1866 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,This announcement
2,null,null,though expected for some time past
3,null,null,gave an amazing fillip to everybody 's interest in the work
4,surprise,strange,The strange spectacle was witnessed of all hands being anxious to quit a snug harbour for the sea
5,null,null,where stern
6,null,null,hard wrestling with the elements was the rule
7,null,null,The captain
8,null,null,well pleased with the eagerness manifested
9,null,null,had his boat manned for a trip to the entrance of the harbour
10,null,null,to see what the weather was like outside
11,null,null,since it was not possible to judge from where the ship lay .
1895 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,We spent ten happy days in Honolulu
2,null,null,marred only by one or two drunken rows among the chaps forward
3,null,null,which
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,resulted in their getting a severe dressing down in the forecastle
6,null,null,where good order was now kept
7,null,null,There had been no need for interference on the part of the officers
8,happiness,glad,which I was glad to see
9,null,null,remembering what would have happened under such circumstances not long ago
10,null,null,Being short-handed
11,null,null,the captain engaged a number of friendly islanders for a limited period
12,null,null,on the understanding that they were to be discharged at their native place
13,null,null,Vau Vau .
1898 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,But Odin
2,null,null,who had found that nothing served the wishes of lovers more than tough persistency
3,disgust,shame,though he was stung with the shame of his double rebuff
4,null,null,nevertheless
5,null,null,effacing the form he had worn before
6,null,null,went to the king for the third time
7,null,null,professing the most complete skill in soldier ship .
1910 33
 (23, 2),
1,null,null,About a year later
2,null,null,Mr Semple died
3,null,null,It was an untimely death
4,null,null,one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are
5,null,null,nevertheless
6,null,null,dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned
7,null,null,He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat and had insisted on going to business when Mrs
8,null,null,Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate
9,null,null,He was in his way a very determined person
10,null,null,not obstreperously so
11,null,null,but quietly and under the surface
12,null,null,Business was a great urge
13,null,null,He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars
14,null,null,Then this cold nine more days of pneumonia and he was dead
15,null,null,The shoe store was closed for a few days
16,null,null,the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people
17,null,null,There was a funeral
18,null,null,with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church
19,null,null,to which they belonged
20,null,null,and then he was buried
21,null,null,Mrs
22,null,null,Semple cried bitterly
23,sadness,in a depressed state,The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state
24,null,null,A brother of hers
25,null,null,David Wiggin
26,null,null,undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her
27,null,null,There was no will
28,null,null,but in the final adjustment
29,null,null,which included the sale of the shoe business
30,null,null,there being no desire on anybody 's part to contest her right to all the property
31,null,null,she received over eighteen thousand dollars
32,null,null,She continued to reside in the Front Street house
33,null,null,and was considered a charming and interesting widow .
1914 11
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,And so it was indeed :  she was now only ten inches high
2,null,null,and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First
3,null,null,however
4,fear,nervous,she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further :  she felt a little nervous about this
5,null,null,for it might end
6,null,null,you know
7,null,null,' said Alice to herself
8,null,null,in my going out altogether
9,null,null,like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then
10,null,null,' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out
11,null,null,for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing

 (3, 2),
1,null,null,He chased the two pigs and they ran and hid in their houses
2,null,null,The big bad wolf went to the first house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in minutes
3,fear,frightened,The frightened little pig ran to the second pigs house that was made of sticks .
1917 3
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,The big bad wolf now came to this house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in hardly any time
2,null,null,Now
3,fear,terrified,the two little pigs were terrified and ran to the third pigs house that was made of bricks .
1918 2
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,felt sorry for,The two little pigs now felt sorry for having been so lazy
2,null,null,They too built their houses with bricks and lived happily ever after .
1944 15
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
2,null,null,others sprang into the sea
3,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
4,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
5,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
6,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
7,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
8,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
9,null,null,now beaten this way
10,null,null,now that
11,sadness,despaired,and when night fell I despaired for my life
12,null,null,but
13,null,null,weary and spent as I was
14,null,null,I clung to my frail support
15,null,null,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island .

1,null,null,One evening in April in the year 1308
2,null,null,Tirechair came home in a remarkably bad temper
3,null,null,For three days past everything had been in good order on the King 's highway
4,null,null,Now
5,null,null,as an officer of the peace
6,null,null,nothing annoyed him so much as to feel himself useless
7,anger,rage,He flung down his halbert in a rage
8,null,null,muttered inarticulate words as he pulled off his doublet
9,null,null,half red and half blue
10,null,null,and slipped on a shabby camlet jerkin .

 (3, 4),
1,null,null,' that 's true
2,null,null,' said Shmuel
3,sadness,tears,lowering the fence again and looking at the ground with tears in his eyes

1964 5
 (4, 3),(4, 4),
1,null,null,Shmuel reached down and lifted the base of the fence
2,null,null,but it only lifted to a certain height and Bruno had no choice but to roll under it
3,null,null,getting his striped pyjamas completely covered in mud as he did so
4,happiness,laughed,He laughed when he looked down at himself
5,null,null,He had never been so filthy in all his life and it felt wonderful .

2007 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Scarlett had no awe of her father and felt him more her contemporary than her sisters
2,sadness,guilty,for jumping fences and keeping it a secret from his wife gave him a boyish pride and guilty glee that matched her own pleasure in outwitting Mammy .
2011 3
 (3, 1),(3, 2),
1,null,null,When one remembers that in 1950 Red Lewis died in Rome
2,null,null,alone and friendless
3,sadness,sadness,the sadness is intensified .
2025 2

2053 30
 (7, 8),
1,null,null,An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes
2,null,null,and feebly stretching out one paw
3,null,null,trying to touch her Poor little thing
4,null,null,' said Alice
5,null,null,in a coaxing tone
6,null,null,and she tried hard to whistle to it
7,fear,frightened,but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry
8,null,null,in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did
9,null,null,she picked up a little bit of stick
10,null,null,and held it out to the puppy
11,null,null,whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once
12,null,null,with a yelp of delight
13,null,null,and rushed at the stick
14,null,null,and made believe to worry it
15,null,null,then Alice dodged behind a great thistle
16,null,null,to keep herself from being run over
17,null,null,and the moment she appeared on the other side
18,null,null,the puppy made another rush at the stick
19,null,null,and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
20,null,null,then Alice
21,null,null,thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse
22,null,null,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet
23,null,null,ran round the thistle again
24,null,null,then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick
25,null,null,running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back
26,null,null,and barking hoarsely all the while
27,null,null,till at last it sat down a good way off
28,null,null,panting
29,null,null,with its tongue hanging out of its mouth
30,null,null,and its great eyes half shut .
2063 18
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,I said  "  What for
2,null,null,"  '  She boxed the Queen 's ears ' the Rabbit began . Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh
3,null,null,hush
4,fear,frightened,' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you
5,null,null,You see
6,null,null,she came rather late
7,null,null,and the Queen said '  Get to your places
8,null,null,' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
9,null,null,and people began running about in all directions
10,null,null,tumbling up against each other
11,null,null,however
12,null,null,they got settled down in a minute or two
13,null,null,and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life
14,null,null,it was all ridges and furrows
15,null,null,the balls were live hedgehogs
16,null,null,the mallets live flamingoes
17,null,null,and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet
18,null,null,to make the arches

2,null,null,had almost lost his lameness
3,null,null,and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue
4,null,null,His nerves had become less painfully sensitive
5,null,null,and when after his first skirmish
6,null,null,during which he had kept close to King James
7,null,null,far too much terrified to stir an inch from him
8,null,null,he had not only found himself perfectly safe
9,null,null,but had been much praised for his valour
10,null,null,he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery
11,null,null,and
12,null,null,what with use
13,null,null,and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity
14,null,null,he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle
15,null,null,Perhaps
16,null,null,indeed
17,null,null,Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf
18,null,null,in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward
19,fear,fear,and his fear lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such .
