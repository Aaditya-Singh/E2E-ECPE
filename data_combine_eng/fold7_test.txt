5,sadness,Heartbroken,Heartbroken
6,null,null,the guy agreed .
1480 11
 (7, 8),
1,null,null,As regards language
2,null,null,versification
3,null,null,and general spirit
4,null,null,the matter is beyond controversy
5,null,null,but when we come to consider the incidents of the story
6,null,null,we find deviations from Homer even more serious than any of those from the Cyclic poets
7,surprise,strange,And the strange thing is
8,null,null,that each of these deviations is a manifest detriment to the perfection of his poem
9,null,null,in each of them the writer has missed
10,null,null,or has rejected
11,null,null,a magnificent opportunity .
1503 5
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Yea
2,sadness,wrung,and achilles ' very heart was wrung With love 's remorse to have slain a thing so sweet
3,null,null,Who might have borne her home

3,sadness,grief,Swiftly from Helicon the Muses came heart burdened with undying grief
4,null,null,for love And honour to the Nereid starry eyed .
1542 5

1,null,null,For out of depths of sorrow rose their moan
2,null,null,And all the armour
3,null,null,yea
4,null,null,the tents
5,sadness,sorrowing,the ships Of that great sorrowing multitude were wet With tears from ever welling springs of grief .
1545 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,Nor stayed the immortal steeds of aeacus ' son Tearless beside the ships
2,sadness,mourned,they also mourned Their slain king :  sorely loth were they to abide Longer mid mortal men or Argive steeds Bearing a burden of consuming grief .
1587 3
 (1, 1),
1,sadness,undeserved,The good man oft is whelmed In suffering :  wealth undeserved is heaped On the vile person
2,null,null,Blind is each man 's life
3,null,null,Therefore he never walketh surely .
1589 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,But in a several place The multitude of heroes slain they laid
2,sadness,Mourning,Mourning with stricken hearts
3,null,null,On one great pyre They burnt them all

3,null,null,Who smiled for pleasure and for eagerness To haste to the ship .
1638 6

1,null,null,Then did the Goddess strike him utterly blind
2,null,null,Stared his fixed eyeballs white from pits of blood
3,sadness,groaned,And all folk groaned for pity of their friend
4,null,null,And dread of the prey giver
5,null,null,lest he had sinned In folly against her
6,null,null,and his mind was thus Warped to destruction yea .
1648 4

1,null,null,This should offend The Prayers

1699 5
 (4, 5),
1,null,null,My Lord Peterborough is come unexpected from Tangier
2,null,null,to give the King an account of the place
3,null,null,which
4,fear,fear,we fear
5,null,null,is in none of the best condition We had also certain news to-day that the Spaniard is before Lisbone with thirteen sayle .
1703 3
 (2, 3),
1,null,null,No more Cared they for deeds of men
2,sadness,cried,but cried to the Gods For swift feet
3,null,null,in whose feet alone was hope To escape eurymachus ' and aeneas ' spears Which lightened ever all along their rear .
1707 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Fate forbade That hero any longer to contend With Argive foes without the high built wall
2,null,null,Yea
3,fear,feared,and his mother sorely feared the wrath Of Pallas passing wise
4,null,null,whose heart was keen To help the Danaans now  .
1718 2
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,So without sound of voices marched they on Unto the trojans ' fortress
2,happiness,eager,eager all To help those mighty chiefs with foes begirt .
1725 9
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,The third mate was nothing much but bad temper not much sailor
2,null,null,nor much whaler
3,null,null,generally in hot water with the skipper
4,disgust,hated,who hated him because he was an  "  owner 's man
5,null,null,"  An de fourf mate
6,null,null,"   wound up the narrator
7,null,null,straightening his huge bulk
8,null,null,"  am de best man in de ship
9,null,null,and de biggest .
1726 4
 (2, 2),
1,null,null,It was a splendid picture
2,happiness,glad,but for the time I felt glad I was not on board of her
3,null,null,a very few minutes she was out of our ken
4,null,null,followed by the admiration of all .
1736 5
 (1, 3),
1,happiness,happy,When we got on board we felt quite happy
2,null,null,and
3,null,null,for the first time since leaving America
4,null,null,we had a little singing
5,null,null,all I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey 's hymns
1751 7
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,As far as I could judge
2,happiness,happiest,they were the happiest of people
3,null,null,literally taking no thought for the morrow and content with the barest necessaries of life
4,null,null,so long as they were free and the sun shone brightly
5,null,null,We had many opportunities of cultivating their acquaintance
6,null,null,for the captain allowed us much liberty
7,null,null,quite one half of the crew and officers being ashore most of the time .
1780 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,Now
2,null,null,with us
3,null,null,whenever the weather was doubtful or squally looking
4,null,null,we shortened sail
5,null,null,and kept it fast till better weather came along
6,null,null,being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred
7,null,null,But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed
8,fear,startled,we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got
9,null,null,This was certainly the case with all of us forward
10,null,null,even to me who had some experience
11,null,null,so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along .
1795 11
 (7, 7),(7, 8),
1,null,null,It was but a school of kogia
2,null,null,or  "  short headed "   cachalots
3,null,null,but as we secured five of them
4,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
5,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
6,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
7,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
8,null,null,they were so lively
9,null,null,but as for danger well
10,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
11,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1808 8
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins
2,null,null,carrying a press of sail day and night
3,null,null,as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries
4,null,null,He was still very lame
5,fear,feared,and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant
6,null,null,Besides
7,null,null,it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship
8,null,null,no matter how good they were .
1813 4
 (4, 3),
1,null,null,This sort of thing was right in his line
2,null,null,Naturally cruel
3,null,null,he seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself in the prospect of making human beings twist and writhe in pain
4,happiness,pleasure,Nor would he be baulked of a jot of his pleasure .
1822 6
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Consequently the state of the ship was filthy
2,null,null,nor could all our efforts keep her clean
3,null,null,This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week
4,null,null,when the officers got so tired of it
5,anger,annoyed,and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard
6,null,null,that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders .
1828 12
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,We took them on board
2,null,null,and the boat returned again
3,null,null,By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern sheets
4,null,null,I felt sure
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,that we should have but little more trouble with our fish
7,null,null,in fact
8,fear,afraid,I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface
9,null,null,in which case he might sink and be lost
10,null,null,We hauled steadily away
11,null,null,the line not coming in very easily
12,null,null,until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out .
1831 6
 (4, 5),(4, 6),
1,null,null,The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness
2,null,null,and should never have occurred
3,null,null,but then
4,surprise,strange,strange to say
5,null,null,disasters to whale boats are nearly always due to want of care
6,null,null,the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related .
1837 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,The captain shook hands with me cordially
2,null,null,pooh poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade
3,happiness,delight,but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe
4,null,null,The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats
5,null,null,though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him
6,null,null,that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once
7,null,null,working all night .
1843 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,News of our coming had preceded us
2,null,null,and the whole native population appeared to be afloat to make us welcome
3,null,null,The air rang again with their shouts of rejoicing
4,happiness,gorgeous feast,for our catch represented to them a gorgeous feast
5,null,null,such as they had not indulged in for many a day
6,null,null,The flesh of the humpbacked whale is not at all bad
7,null,null,being but little inferior to that of the porpoise
1845 9
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,But we lost no time in getting back to the ship
2,null,null,where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into
3,null,null,The captain
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,was very kind
6,happiness,pleasure,expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again
7,null,null,although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future
8,null,null,A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure
9,null,null,so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again .
1853 4
 (1, 1),
1,surprise,startling,Its effect upon him was startling and immediate
2,null,null,He rushed off at so furious a rate dead to windward that for a great while we had all our work cut out to keep her free by baling
3,null,null,The sea had risen a little
4,null,null,and as we leapt from one wave to another the spray flew over us in an almost continuous cloud .
1870 11
 (10, 10),
1,null,null,For the next four days and nights
2,null,null,during which the wind prevented the CHANCE from leaving us
3,null,null,our old ship was a scene of wild revelry
4,null,null,that ceased not through the twenty-four hours  revelry entirely unassisted by strong waters
5,null,null,too
6,null,null,the natural ebullient gaiety of men who were free from anxiety on any account whatever
7,null,null,rejoicing over the glad consummation of more than two years toil
8,null,null,on the one hand
9,null,null,on the other
10,happiness,joy,a splendid sympathy in joy manifested by the satisfied crew under the genial command of Captain Gilroy
11,null,null,With their cheerful help we made wonderful progress
1871 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,dirtier
2,null,null,gloomier
3,null,null,and colder grew the weather
4,null,null,until
5,null,null,reduced to two topsails and a reefed foresail
6,null,null,we were scudding dead before the gale for all we were worth
7,null,null,This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT
8,surprise,curious,and I was curious to see how she would behave
9,null,null,To my mind
10,null,null,the supreme test of a ship 's sea kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without  "  pooping "   a sea
11,null,null,or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage .
1876 10
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,These lines seemed all the deeper to-night
2,null,null,Only a few hours before
3,null,null,Richard had come to her
4,null,null,while Malachi was arranging his clothes
5,null,null,with the joyful news of a new device which he had developed during the day for his motor
6,null,null,He could hardly wait to tell her
7,null,null,he had said
8,happiness,joyful,The news was anything but joyful to her
9,null,null,She knew what it meant she knew what sums had been wasted on the other devices
10,null,null,involving losses which at this time they could so little afford .
1878 8
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,He believes the time will come when they will value his pictures
2,null,null,and be proud to own them
3,null,null,But I dont care who owns mine
4,happiness,fun,I just want the fun of painting them
5,null,null,Just think of what a man can do with a few tubes of color
6,null,null,a brush
7,null,null,and a bit of canvas
8,null,null,So I dont care if they never buy what I paint .
1892 5
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,Ragnar showed on this occasion the most merciful moderation towards the slayer of his dearest son
2,happiness,satisfied,since he sufficiently satisfied the vengeance which he desired
3,null,null,by the exile of the culprit rather than his death
4,null,null,This compassion shamed the Russians out of any further age against such a king
5,null,null,who could not be driven even by the most grievous wrongs to inflict death upon his prisoners .
1897 7
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,Then
2,null,null,to prevent any more troublesome business delaying his hopes of marriage
3,happiness,enjoyed,he went back to Gewar and enjoyed the coveted embraces of Nanna
4,null,null,Next
5,null,null,having treated Helgi and Thora very generously
6,null,null,he brought his new queen back to Sweden
7,null,null,being as much honoured by all for his victory as Balder was laughed at for his flight .
1901 11
 (3, 3),(3, 6),
1,null,null,He had several times taken caravans to Karague
2,null,null,and knew all the languages well
3,sadness,unfortunately,but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied
4,null,null,That
5,null,null,however
6,null,null,I could not foresee
7,null,null,so
8,null,null,trusting to him and good-luck
9,null,null,I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters
10,null,null,but they came and went in the most tantalising manner
11,null,null,notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give .
1905 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .
1926 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Let me say
2,null,null,then
3,null,null,as briefly as possible
4,null,null,that I accompanied the engineer into the interior of the mine
5,happiness,fascinated,and became so strangely fascinated by its gloomy wonders
6,null,null,and so interested in my friend 's explorations
7,null,null,that I prolonged my stay in the neighbourhood .
1935 16
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,I drew a large white and black hornbill and a green pigeon sent by himself
2,sadness,not satisfied,but he was not satisfied
3,null,null,he sent more birds
4,null,null,and wanted to see my shoes
5,null,null,The pages who came with the second message
6,null,null,however
7,null,null,proving impertinent
8,null,null,got a book flung at their heads
9,null,null,and a warning to be off
10,null,null,as I intended to see the king myself
11,null,null,and ask for food to keep my ever complaining Wanguana quiet
12,null,null,Proceeding to the palace
13,null,null,as I found Mtesa had gone out shooting
14,null,null,I called on the Kamraviona
15,null,null,complained that my camp was starving
16,null,null,and as I had nothing left to give the king said I wished to leave the country .
1938 7
 (3, 6),
1,null,null,It wasnt that they could show him anything
2,null,null,it was  only that they could burn clear
3,surprise,surprise,To his surprise
4,null,null,however
5,null,null,after a  while
6,null,null,they did show him something :   the arch of a high doorway  approached by a low terrace of steps
7,null,null,in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end .
1942 14
 (13, 14),
1,null,null,Bruno thought about it
2,null,null,' well
3,null,null,I would n't like it if you were n't there
4,null,null,' he said
5,null,null,because that was the truth
6,null,null,' so you 'd prefer to stay here with me
7,null,null,i 'd prefer all four of us to stay together
8,null,null,' he said
9,null,null,reluctantly including Gretel in that
10,null,null,' whether that was in Berlin or out with
11,null,null,' oh
12,null,null,Bruno
13,anger,exasperated,' said Gretel in an exasperated voice
14,null,null,and he didnt know whether that was because he might be spoiling the plans for their return or because ( according to her ) he continued to mispronounce the name of their home .
1974 13
 (7, 5),(7, 6),
1,null,null,' does the marching go on for long
2,null,null,' he whispered because he was beginning to feel quite hungry now
3,null,null,' i dont think so
4,null,null,' said Shmuel
5,null,null,' i never see the people after they 've gone on a march
6,null,null,But I would n't imagine it does
7,surprise,frowned,Bruno frowned
8,null,null,He looked up at the sky
9,null,null,and as he did so there was another loud sound
10,null,null,this time the sound of thunder overhead
11,null,null,and just as quickly the sky seemed to grow even darker
12,null,null,almost black
13,null,null,and rain poured down even more heavily than it had in the morning .
1981 3
 (1, 1),(1, 3),
1,fear,agitated,Elennor was very agitated about it because it involved a life even though
2,null,null,as she acknowledged
3,null,null,it was the life of a murderer .

6,null,null,reminding Christina of her aunt 's gentle domestic favourite
7,null,null,Ermentrude sat up
8,null,null,and regarded the placing out of them with great interest
9,null,null,and thus her brother left her employed
10,null,null,and so much delighted that she had not flagged
11,null,null,when a great bell proclaimed that it was the time for the noon tide meal
12,null,null,for which Christina

1,null,null,Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable
2,surprise,astounded,and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me
3,null,null,Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view
4,null,null,Desultory readers are seldom  remarkable for the exactness of their learning .
