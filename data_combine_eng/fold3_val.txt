3,null,null,The superior told me that I must deliberate and decide alone
4,null,null,and that when once my decision was taken
5,null,null,there could be no change
6,null,null,So I remained at the asylum
7,null,null,and dined at the superior 's table
8,null,null,and during the night I occupied the room of a sister who was absent
9,surprise,surprised,What surprised me most of all was the deference with which I was treated
10,null,null,The sisters all seemed to consider me a person of great importance
11,null,null,And yet I hesitated .
463 17
 (6, 4),
1,null,null,What a change indeed
2,null,null,At last the count made me retire to one of the compartments
3,null,null,where I soon fell asleep
4,null,null,abandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation from reality
5,null,null,However
6,fear,terribly anxious,when I woke up I became terribly anxious
7,null,null,I asked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey
8,null,null,de Chalusse 's manner continued kind
9,null,null,and even affectionate
10,null,null,but he had regained his accustomed reserve and self-control
11,null,null,and I realized that it would be useless on my part to question him
12,null,null,At last
13,null,null,after a thirty hours ' journey by rail
14,null,null,we again entered the count 's berline
15,null,null,drawn by post horses
16,null,null,and eventually M
17,null,null,de Chalusse said to me :  ' here is Cannes we are at our journey 's end . '
464 27
 (12, 9),
1,null,null,He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion
2,null,null,so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me
3,null,null,I was
4,null,null,indeed
5,null,null,extremely awkward
6,null,null,and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride
7,null,null,I did not know what to say
8,null,null,or what to do
9,null,null,I did not know how to use my hands
10,null,null,nor how to walk
11,null,null,nor how to carry myself
12,sadness,embarrassed,Everything embarrassed and frightened me
13,null,null,and I was conscious of my awkwardness
14,null,null,without being able to remedy it
15,null,null,I saw my blunders
16,null,null,and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me
17,null,null,And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me
18,null,null,For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world
19,null,null,I did not exchange a word with him
20,null,null,but by the quickened throbbing s of my heart
21,null,null,when our eyes met
22,null,null,I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life
23,null,null,and events have since proved that I was not deceived
24,null,null,At that time
25,null,null,however
26,null,null,he was a stranger to me
27,null,null,and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him .
465 22
 (11, 8),
1,null,null,"  By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own
2,null,null,but he did not speak it
3,null,null,He was the kindest and most indulgent of guardians
4,null,null,and I was often affected to tears by his tenderness
5,null,null,But
6,null,null,although my slightest wish was law
7,null,null,he did not grant me his confidence
8,null,null,the mystery that stood between us was like a wall of ice  Still
9,null,null,I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new life
10,null,null,and my mind was regaining its equilibrium
11,disgust,more agitated and excited,when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited
12,null,null,if possible
13,null,null,than on the day of my departure from the asylum
14,null,null,He summoned his valet
15,null,null,and
16,null,null,in a tone that admitted no reply
17,null,null,he exclaimed
18,null,null,' i wish to leave Cannes at once  I must start in less than an hour so procure some post horses instantly
19,null,null,And in answer to my inquiring glance
20,null,null,he said :  ' it must be
21,null,null,It would be folly to hesitate
22,null,null,Each moment increases the peril that threatens us . '
467 11
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,When that day comes I will go to your guardian and ask him for your hand
2,null,null,but in Heaven 's name dont speak now
3,null,null,I understood Pascal 's motives well enough
4,null,null,The count 's immense fortune frightened him
5,fear,feared,and he feared that he would be accused of being a fortune hunter
6,null,null,So I waited
7,null,null,with that secret anguish which still haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is peaceful
8,null,null,and their future seems bright
9,null,null,I kept my secret
10,null,null,saying to myself that such happiness was not meant for me
11,null,null,that it would soon take flight .
471 7
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would certainly have given me
2,null,null,I had his troth
3,null,null,and that sufficed
4,null,null,And it was with a thrill of joy that I said to myself :  ' what does it matter if M
5,anger,angered,de Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive me from his house
6,null,null,It will rather be so much the better
7,null,null,Pascal will protect me . '
482 8
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,"  Quite correct
2,null,null,"   answered the magistrate
3,null,null,and then as if he feared that he had gone too far
4,null,null,he added :   "  but draw your own conclusions respecting the matter
5,null,null,You have the whole night before you
6,null,null,We will talk it over again to-morrow
7,null,null,and if I can be of service to you in any way
8,happiness,be only too glad,I shall be only too glad .  "
491 23
 (20, 20),
1,null,null,Once more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark :   "  There it is again sufficient to live upon
2,null,null,and I expect to receive it from you
3,null,null,Excellent
4,null,null,Women are remarkable creatures
5,null,null,upon my word
6,null,null,But listen to the rest
7,null,null,' it is absolutely necessary that I should see you as soon as possible
8,null,null,Oblige me
9,null,null,therefore
10,null,null,by calling to-morrow
11,null,null,October 15th
12,null,null,at the Hotel de Homburg
13,null,null,in the Rue du Helder
14,null,null,You will ask for Madame Lucy Huntley
15,null,null,and they will conduct you to me
16,null,null,I shall expect you from three o'clock to six
17,null,null,Come
18,null,null,I implore you
19,null,null,come
20,sadness,painful,It is painful to me to add that if I do not hear from you
21,null,null,I am resolved to demand and OBTAIN no matter what may be the consequences the means which I have
22,null,null,so far
23,null,null,asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands
492 22
 (11, 11),
1,null,null,Having finished the letter
2,null,null,Casimir laid it on the table
3,null,null,and poured out a glass full of brandy
4,null,null,which he drained at a single draught
5,null,null,"  And that 's all
6,null,null,"   he remarked
7,null,null,"  No signature not even an initial
8,null,null,It was a so-called respectable woman who wrote that
9,null,null,They never sign their notes
10,null,null,the hussies
11,fear,fear,for fear of compromising themselves
12,null,null,as i 've reason to know
13,null,null,And so saying
14,null,null,he laughed the idiotic laugh of a man who has been drinking immoderate ly
15,null,null,"  If I had time
16,null,null,"   he resumed
17,null,null,"  I should make some inquiries about this Madame Lucy Huntley a feigned name
18,null,null,evidently
19,null,null,I should like to know   But what 's the matter with you
20,null,null,Monsieur Fortunat
21,null,null,You are as pale as death
22,null,null,Are you ill

 (1, 1),
1,sadness,sighed,Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again
2,null,null,It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total
3,null,null,if you included the basement
4,null,null,where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you were n't supposed to use
5,null,null,And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly .
505 9
 (3, 7),(3, 8),
1,null,null,' oh my
2,null,null,' said Mother with a laugh
3,sadness,didnt look happy,although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didnt look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didnt want him to see her face
4,null,null,' yes
5,null,null,Bruno
6,null,null,' she said
7,null,null,' it 's more than a mile away
8,null,null,Quite a lot more than that
9,null,null,in fact . '
526 9
 (8, 5),
1,null,null,' of course I did
2,null,null,' she replied
3,null,null,' you dont think i 'd have left them at home
4,null,null,Why
5,null,null,it could be weeks before we 're back there again
6,null,null,' weeks
7,null,null,' said Bruno
8,happiness,pleased,sounding disappointed but secretly pleased because he 'd resigned himself to the idea of spending a month there
9,null,null,' do you really think so
551 8
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,' everything here is horrible
2,anger,loud,' he said out loud
3,null,null,even though there was no one present to hear him
4,null,null,but somehow it  made him feel better to hear the words stated anyway
5,null,null,' i hate this house
6,null,null,I hate my room and I even hate the paintwork
7,null,null,I hate it all
8,null,null,Absolutely everything . '
560 8
 (3, 1),
1,null,null,' stupid Father
2,null,null,' he added under his breath
3,surprise,eyes opened wide,Maria 's eyes opened wide and she took a step towards him
4,null,null,her hands covering her mouth for a moment in horror
5,null,null,She looked round to make sure that no one was listening to them and had heard what Bruno had just said
6,null,null,' you must n't say that
7,null,null,' she said
8,null,null,' you must never say something like that about your father . '
578 9
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,Franz was one of the young men who fought for us in the trenches
2,null,null,Your father knew him very well back then
3,null,null,I believe they served together
4,null,null,' and what happened to him
5,null,null,' asked Bruno
6,null,null,' it does n't matter
7,null,null,' said Mother
8,null,null,' war is not a fit subject for conversation
9,fear,afraid,im afraid we 'll be spending too much time talking about it soon . '

1,null,null,On Christmas Day Father wore his brand-new uniform
2,null,null,the starched and pressed one that he wore every day now
3,happiness,applauded,and the whole family applauded when he first appeared in it
4,null,null,It really was something special
5,null,null,Compared to the other soldiers who came in and out of the house
6,null,null,he stood out
7,null,null,and they seemed to respect him all the more now that he had it
8,null,null,Mother went up to him and kissed him on the cheek and ran a hand across the front of it
9,null,null,commenting on how fine she thought the fabric was
10,null,null,Bruno was particularly impressed by all the decorations on the uniform and he had been allowed to wear the cap for a short period
11,null,null,provided his hands were clean when he put it on .

1,null,null,' he did come to harm

4,null,null,' take a look at him for your evidence
5,null,null,' and now look at you
6,null,null,' continued Grandfather
7,null,null,ignoring her
8,null,null,' it makes me so proud to see you elevated to such a responsible position
9,null,null,Helping your country reclaim her pride after all the great wrongs that were done to her
10,null,null,The punishments above and beyond '' oh

12,anger,cried,' cried Grandmother
13,null,null,' which one of you is the most foolish
14,null,null,I wonder

1,null,null,Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air

5,null,null,' my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four

9,null,null,' i said my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four . '
607 7
 (6, 1),
1,null,null,' the Fury has something he wants to discuss with me
2,null,null,' said Father
3,null,null,who was allowed to interrupt Mother even if no one else was
4,null,null,I just got a phone call this afternoon
5,null,null,The only time he can make it is Thursday evening and he 's invited himself to dinner
6,surprise,eyes opened wide and her mouth  made the shape of an O,Mother 's eyes opened wide and her mouth  made the shape of an O
7,null,null,Bruno stared at her and wondered whether this was what he looked like when he was surprised about something .
608 11
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs
2,null,null,where they received a rare invitation into Father 's office
3,null,null,Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls
4,null,null,Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts
5,null,null,a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie
6,happiness,proud,He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them
7,null,null,even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk
8,null,null,All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant
9,null,null,all the same
10,null,null,because Bruno and Gretel were n't even invited to dinner
11,null,null,they had eaten an hour earlier .
618 8
 (2, 1),
1,null,null,' herr Liszt wont let us read poetry or plays
2,sadness,complained,' complained Bruno during the main course
3,null,null,As they had company for dinner
4,null,null,the family were dressed formally Father in his uniform
5,null,null,Mother in a green dress that set off her eyes
6,null,null,and Gretel and Bruno in the clothes they wore to church when they lived in Berlin
7,null,null,' i asked him if we could read them just one day a week but he said no

7,null,null,shaking his head and looking as if he was going to cry
8,null,null,' he 'll come back
9,null,null,I know he will
10,null,null,' he continued
11,null,null,his sentences running quickly together
12,null,null,' i should have eaten them when you offered them
13,null,null,now it 's too late
14,null,null,if I take them he 'll come in and '
662 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Bruno had the shampoo as well
2,null,null,but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno 's hair off
3,null,null,which  made Bruno cry
4,disgust,hated,It didnt take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet
5,null,null,but Father said it had to be done .
667 8
 (6, 6),
1,null,null,Nothing at all changed for a few weeks
2,null,null,life went on as normal
3,null,null,Father spent most of his time either in his office or on the other side of the fence
4,null,null,Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps
5,null,null,some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch
6,fear,worried,and Bruno was worried for her health because he 'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries
7,null,null,Gretel stayed in her room concentrating on the various maps she had pasted on the walls and consulting the newspapers for hours at a time before moving the pins around a little
8,null,null,( Herr Liszt was particularly pleased with her for doing this .  )

3,fear,feared,for he feared that he might be pursued and overtaken by MCasimir
4,null,null,But after he had gone a couple of hundred paces
5,null,null,he paused
6,null,null,not so much to take breath
7,null,null,as to collect his scattered wits
8,null,null,and though the weather was cold
9,null,null,he seated himself on a bench to reflect .

9,null,null,and these precautions he kept up during an entire month .
814 11
 (8, 8),
1,null,null,At ten o'clock we went down to supper
2,null,null,and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month
3,null,null,I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr
4,null,null,Perkupp should come by mere chance
5,null,null,Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of champagne
6,null,null,and drinking it straight off

6,null,null,great and small
7,null,null,in those days

12,null,null,Unfortunately
13,null,null,for him
14,null,null,he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field magnetism and vision
15,null,null,He was not destined to be a great financier

5,null,null,accusing him of being too proud
6,null,null,in having at once two such distinguished guests
7,null,null,and meant by these acts only to humble him
8,null,null,I replied
9,null,null,if that was the case
10,null,null,the sooner he allowed us to go
11,null,null,the better it would be for him
12,null,null,and

5,null,null,and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted
6,null,null,Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers

6,null,null,like a discarded dress

8,null,null,She did not see it

7,null,null,but the sorrow and anger would be only for a little while
8,null,null,Then Martin and she would live happily together always happily because they were both sensible people

2,null,null,The tune was a moving one

2,null,null,her strangeness
3,null,null,her strength and loneliness
4,happiness,touched,young and solitary like the moon above him and yet also some feeling softer than interest so that he was suddenly touched as he thought of her and spoke out aloud :   "  i 'll be good to her whatever happens
5,null,null,by God i 'll be good to her
6,null,null,"   so that a chauffeur near him turned and looked with hard scornful eyes

6,sadness,embarrass,embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her
7,null,null,she could out of the corner of her eye see the ruddy brown of his cheek and the hard thick curve of his shoulder .

16,null,null,gathered round him
17,null,null,kissing his hands and begging his blessing

5,null,null,than the impression she had made on him would fade away

3,null,null,strong thoughts of her were in his mind
4,null,null,And despite his involved social and financial position
5,null,null,which he now recalled
6,happiness,interesting,it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even calculatingly and worse
7,null,null,enthusiastically  he was pumping the bellows that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl
8,null,null,to feed a fire that might ultimately consume him and how deliberately and resourcefully
1282 8
 (3, 2),
1,null,null,At the same time

5,null,null,some financial
6,null,null,While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband 's death

5,null,null,Drexel & Co
6,null,null,and Cooke & Co
7,null,null,and others and urge them to sustain the market
8,null,null,They could strengthen things generally by organizing a buying ring
9,null,null,and under cover of their support
10,null,null,if they would
11,null,null,he might sell enough to let him out
12,null,null,and even permit him to go short and make something a whole lot
13,null,null,It was a brilliant thought
14,null,null,worthy of a greater situation
15,null,null,and its only weakness was that it was not absolutely certain of fulfillment .
1316 5
 (5, 5),
1,null,null,Owen was running swiftly in his mind over Cowperwood 's affairs as much as he knew of them
2,null,null,He felt keenly that the banker ought to be shaken out

6,null,null,afraid of Cowperwood
7,fear,afraid,afraid of life and of himself
8,null,null,The thought of panic
9,null,null,loss
10,null,null,was not so much a definite thing connected with his own property
11,null,null,his money
12,null,null,as it was with his social and political standing in the community .

1729 9
 (2, 3),(2, 4),
1,null,null,However
2,sadness,painfully,the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident
3,null,null,for we had a visit from the afterguard in force one afternoon
4,null,null,and Abner with his brewage was haled to the quarter deck
5,null,null,There
6,null,null,in the presence of all hands
7,null,null,he was arraigned
8,null,null,found guilty of stealing the ship 's stores
9,null,null,and sentence passed upon him .
1754 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being
2,null,null,for never a spout did we see
3,happiness,delight,And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black fish
4,null,null,the first we had run across for a long time
5,null,null,Determined to have a big catch
6,null,null,if possible
7,null,null,we lowered all five boats
8,null,null,as it was a beautifully calm day
9,null,null,and the ship might almost safely have been left to look after herself .
1758 9
 (3, 3),(3, 4),
1,null,null,Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity
2,null,null,and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore
3,surprise,surprised,Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the  "  home "   is precisely the same as it is outside
4,null,null,and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style
5,null,null,With the exception of the sleeping accommodation
6,null,null,most men prefer the boarding-house

8,null,null,if they preserve the same commercial status which is a SINE QUA NON at the  "  home
9,null,null,"   they are treated like gentlemen

2,null,null,however
3,null,null,we were better off than in an ordinary merchantman
4,disgust,mad,where doldrums are enough to drive you mad
5,null,null,The one object being to get along
6,null,null,it is incessant  "  pully hauly

1783 8

1,null,null,But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea sickness
2,null,null,half starved and hopeless
3,sadness,broken,their spirit had been so broken
4,null,null,and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force
5,null,null,aided by deadly weapons aft
6,null,null,that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves
7,null,null,My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites
8,null,null,as I have before noted
1788 5
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,There was no thunder
2,null,null,but a low hissing and a crackling which did not amount to noise
3,null,null,although distinctly audible to all
4,sadness,unpleasant,Sensations most unpleasant of pricking and general irritation were felt by every one
5,null,null,according to their degree of susceptibility .
1795 11
 (7, 7),(7, 8),
1,null,null,It was but a school of kogia
2,null,null,or  "  short headed "   cachalots
3,null,null,but as we secured five of them
4,null,null,averaging seven barrels each
5,null,null,with scarcely any trouble
6,null,null,I felt quite pleased with myself
7,happiness,exciting,We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them
8,null,null,they were so lively
9,null,null,but as for danger well
10,null,null,they only seemed like big  "  black fish "   to us now
11,null,null,and we quite enjoyed the fun .
1811 7

1,null,null,As I bent to my oar
2,sadness,sorry,I felt very sorry for what had happened
3,null,null,Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer
4,null,null,which
5,null,null,according to the severe code under which we lived
6,null,null,merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted
7,null,null,and lasting for the rest of the voyage .
1814 12

7,happiness,exciting,Waiting for that whale to rise was one of the most exciting experiences we had gone through as yet
8,null,null,with two other ships so near
9,null,null,Everybody 's nerves seemed strung up to concert pitch
10,null,null,and it was quite a relief when from half a dozen throats at once burst the cry

4,null,null,shook like one in an ague fit
5,null,null,the tears ran down in a continuous stream
6,surprise,amazed,while people stared amazed at me

9,null,null,that I was another drunken sailor .
1843 7

1,null,null,News of our coming had preceded us
2,null,null,and the whole native population appeared to be afloat to make us welcome
3,null,null,The air rang again with their shouts of rejoicing
4,happiness,gorgeous feast,for our catch represented to them a gorgeous feast
5,null,null,such as they had not indulged in for many a day
6,null,null,The flesh of the humpbacked whale is not at all bad
7,null,null,being but little inferior to that of the porpoise
1848 4
 (3, 3),
1,null,null,A corn cob cigarette closed the banquet
2,null,null,After expressing my thanks
3,sadness,uneasiness,I noticed that the pain of his leg was giving my friend considerable uneasiness
4,null,null,which he was stolidly enduring upon my account rather than appear discourteous ly anxious to get rid of me .
1856 7
 (4, 4),
1,null,null,Rushing out of their house
2,null,null,they saw the heavens bespread with an awful pall of smoke
3,null,null,the underside of which was glowing with the reflected fires of some vast furnace
4,fear,terror,Their terror was increased by a smart shower of falling ashes and the reverberations of subterranean thunders
5,null,null,At first they thought of flight in their boat
6,null,null,not reckoning the wide stretch of sea which rolled between them and the nearest land
7,null,null,but the height and frequency of the breakers then prevailing made that impossible .
1868 11
 (9, 9),
1,null,null,not far enough to get anywhere that an anchor might hold
2,null,null,and there to leeward
3,null,null,within less than a dozen miles
4,null,null,loomed grim and gloomy one of the most terrific rock bound coasts in the world
5,null,null,The shift of wind had placed the CHANCE farther to leeward than all the rest
6,null,null,a good mile and a half nearer the shore
7,null,null,and we could well imagine how anxiously her movements were being watched by the others
8,null,null,who
9,sadness,jealousy,in spite of their jealousy of his good luck
10,null,null,knew well and appreciated fully Paddy 's marvellous seamanship
11,null,null,as well as his unparalleled knowledge of the coast .

1,null,null,Frode was thus forced to quit the wars of the East and fought a great battle in Sweden with his sister Swanhwid
2,null,null,in which he was beaten
3,null,null,So he got on board a skiff

5,null,null,seeking some way of boring through the enemy 's fleet
6,surprise,surprised,When surprised by his sister and asked why he was rowing silently and following divers meandering courses

1,null,null,They were Goliath and the skipper
2,null,null,Captain Slocum 's right hand went naturally to his hip pocket
3,null,null,where he always carried a revolver
4,null,null,but before he could draw it
5,null,null,the long
6,null,null,black arms of his adversary wrapped around him
7,sadness,helpless,making him helpless as a babe
8,null,null,Then
9,null,null,with a rush that sent every one flying out of his way
10,null,null,Goliath hurled himself at the bulwarks
11,null,null,which were low
12,null,null,the top of the rail about thirty-three inches from the deck
13,null,null,The two bodies struck the rail with a heavy thud
14,null,null,instantly toppling overboard
15,null,null,That broke the spell that bound everybody
16,null,null,so that there was an instantaneous rush to the side
17,null,null,Only a hardly noticeable ripple remained on the surface of the placid sea .
1905 13
 (8, 7),
1,null,null,No one knew of a lake to supply the waters
2,null,null,nor where they came from
3,null,null,That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places and they lay exactly on the equator
4,null,null,Rising out of the valley
5,null,null,I found all the country just as hilly as before
6,null,null,but many of the rush drains going to northward
7,null,null,and in the dells were such magnificent trees
8,surprise,surprise,they quite took me by surprise
9,null,null,clean trunked
10,null,null,they towered up just as so many great pillars
11,null,null,and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us
12,null,null,I thought of the blue gums of Australia
13,null,null,and believed these would beat them .

1,null,null,Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it
2,null,null,others sprang into the sea
3,null,null,but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean
4,null,null,leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire
5,null,null,Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up
6,null,null,and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides
7,null,null,no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves
8,null,null,All that day I floated up and down
9,null,null,now beaten this way
10,null,null,now that
